# NLP_Mimic


## create virtual python environment 
This will depend on OS and how python is installed. On linux can use either conda or venv. 

## with venv

```
# You only need to run this command once per-VM
sudo apt-get install python3-venv -y

# The rest of theses steps should be run every time you create
#  a new notebook (and want a virutal environment for it)

cd the/directory/your/notebook/will/be/in

# Create the virtual environment
# The '--system-site-packages' flag allows the python packages 
#  we installed by default to remain accessible in the virtual 
#  environment.  It's best to use this flag if you're doing this
#  on AI Platform Notebooks so that you keep all the pre-baked 
#  goodness
python3 -m venv myenv --system-site-packages
source myenv/bin/activate #activate the virtual env

# Register this env with jupyter lab. It’ll now show up in the
#  launcher & kernels list once you refresh the page
python -m ipykernel install --user --name=myenv

# Any python packages you pip install now will persist only in
#  this environment_
deactivate # exit the virtual env


```

## with conda

```

conda update conda

conda create -n yourenvname python=3.9 anaconda

source activate yourenvname

```

## git clone this repo

```
git clone https://github.com/NtaylorOX/NLP_Mimic.git 
```
## change into the directory where the cloned files - likely 

```
cd NLP_Mimic/
```
## Use pip package manager

pip install -r requirements.txt
