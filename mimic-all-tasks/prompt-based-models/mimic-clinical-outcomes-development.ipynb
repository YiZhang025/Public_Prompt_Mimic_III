The patient was visiting his partner in the ICU earlier today. He was awake and conversant in the morning with no acute complaints. He was noted to be sleeping on the floor, but walked to the chair by himself when he was awakened. Later in the afternoon, the patient was noted to still be asleep in the chair. He was unarousable with verbal stimuli or sternal rub, so he was taken down to the ED. . In the ED, the patient was initially altered, but was otherwise hemodynamically stable. No urine incontinence or e/o toxidromes. Labs notable for EtOH 86, Osms 366, anion gap 16, lactate 3.8. Utox positive for barbs, but Stox and Utox otherwise negative. Given high serum osmolar gap (60), toxicology was consulted for concern of toxic alcohol ingestion. Most likely isopropyl alcohol given osmolar gap with small anion gap (likely due to lactate) and access to CalStat in the hospital today. However, given a dose of Fomepizole 15mg/kg IVx1 in the ED for possible ethylene glycol vs methanol ingestion. Also given Diazepam 10mg x1 for EtOH withdrawal.

The patient was visiting his partner in the ICU earlier today. He was awake and conversant in the morning with no acute complaints. He was noted to be sleeping on the floor, but walked to the chair by himself when he was awakened. Later in the afternoon, the patient was noted to still be asleep in the chair. He was unarousable with verbal stimuli or sternal rub, so he was taken down to the ED. . In the ED, the patient was initially altered, but was otherwise hemodynamically stable. No urine incontinence or e/o toxidromes. Labs notable for EtOH 86, Osms 366, anion gap 16, lactate 3.8. Utox positive for barbs, but Stox and Utox otherwise negative. Given high serum osmolar gap (60), toxicology was consulted for concern of toxic alcohol ingestion. Most likely isopropyl alcohol given osmolar gap with small anion gap (likely due to lactate) and access to CalStat in the hospital today. However, given a dose of Fomepizole 15mg/kg IVx1 in the ED for possible ethylene glycol vs methanol ingestion. Also given Diazepam 10mg x1 for EtOH withdrawal.

He was recently noted to have been started on tetracycline in the outpatient setting then subsequently developed these symptoms.

A Head CT was done and showed an extensive SDH extending along the tentorium, largest along the R frontal convexity.

He was transferred to the MICU for increasing oxygen requirement and respiratory distress. . Hospital Course: The patient was previously living in an [**Hospital3 **] facility, independent with a baseline mental status of AOx3, and independent ambulation with mechanical limbs. The patient has has many falls in the past, and recently had a fall one month ago getting out of bed because he was not wearing his prosthetics at the time. Per discussion with his family, the patient had been complaining of symptoms of failure to thrive over the past two months prior to admission including fatigue and anorexia/decreased PO intake associated with dysphagia that has been present since he was intubated for his CABG a few years ago. A few weeks prior to admission, his symptoms worsened to include SOB, weakness, and headache. He saw his PCP two times prior to admission (once on [**5-29**] and had a Head CT that was negative at the time and once the day of his OSH admission). He had also been started on TCNs by his dermatologist for a presumed total body skin infection (doxycycline on [**5-8**], changed to minocycline after 2 days due to nausea, stopped after 10 days of treatment). Not taking meds for 3-4 days prior to admission. He presented to [**Hospital3 **] on [**6-6**] after being seen by his PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was found to have an INR of 5.9. He also reported galactorrhea for which is his spiranolactone was held. His dysphagia was treated with Reglan, PPI, and he had a barium swallow. He became aggitated and combative and a head CT showed bilateral subdural hematomas. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] neurosurgical service for further care.  . On [**6-9**] he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] and had a R crainiotomy to relieve the subdural hematoma. He was in the SICU and intubated from [**6-10**] for OR to [**6-11**]. He was extubated successfully but had a high O2 requirement on a face tent. He was noted to be less arousable, and a head CT was performed which showed stable subdural, subarachnoid and intraventricular hemorrhage and an ABG demonstrated a mixed respiratory and metabolic alkalosis (7.57/27/106/25). His subdural drain was d/c-ed on [**6-12**]. He was noted on [**6-16**] to have hypoxia to 88% which improved with 20 of IV lasix and increase in O2 requirement to 4 L NC. His Keppra was stopped on [**6-17**]. His mental status was noted to be waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] during his post-operative course, at some points noted to be more lucid by his family 2 days prior to MICU transfer, but never returning to his baseline pre-operative mental status. On [**6-19**], patient had a speech and swallow consult which demonstrated diminished swallowing capacity with signs/symptoms of aspiration in the setting of altered mental status. However, decision was made to place a PEG for temporary nutrition to improve his healing post-operatively (with the understanding that it was not be a permanent method of nutrition, as patient has not desired this on previous admissions). He had 2 Head CTs post-op that showed stability/improvemnt of SDH, but a repeat Head CT on [**6-20**] demonstrated a new R infarction of the right medial temporo-occipital region, in the PCA territory, thought to be thrombo-embolic in the setting of his AF and lack of anticoagulation. . The day of transfer, the patient was noted to spike a low grade fever, more respiratory distress, with continued desaturations down to 80% on 70% face mask, and onset of tachycardia to 140s. He received deep suctioning without effect on his oxygenation, and lasix 10 mg IV x1 with resultant hypotension to 80s ((previously SBPs of 100s on the floor) so no further diuresis was performed. MERIT was consulted for treatment of his hypoxia and tachycardia, and recommended starting Vancomycin and Zosyn, and continuing his lasix 20 mg PO daily and metoprolol 50 mg PO BID (did not recommend up-titration due to his low blood pressures). However, the patient's hypoxia, tachycardia, and hypotension persisted, resulting in MICU consultation and transfer. . Pt.s respiratory distress improved and doboff tube placement was initially successful but pt. pulled out tube. It was retried several times but unsuccessful.\\n\\nMEDICAL HISTORY: CAD, s/p CABG, Sick sinus syndrome requiring pacer, AAA s/p repair. PVD, s/p Rt BKA and left TMA.

The EKG from that office is unavailable, but patient stated that Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3357**] told him that back pain such as his could be a sign of an MI and he was sent to [**Hospital1 18**] ED for evaluation.  Patient states that last thursday he was swimming in the pool, as he usually does for 40 minutes, afterwards went to the sauna, and once he was done was wiping his sweat and felt that he had some back pain while moving his arms about. He states that the pain was different from the usual musculoskeletal pain that he gets with movement (around his ribs in the axilla, which he had for years). The pain never went away and was worse with movement, especially with movement of back muscles. The area between the scapulas is also slightly tender to deep palpation. What helps is the Solaraze gel (diclofenac) cream that he got from a Russian doctor [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 15158**]. The help subsides but never goes away completely. His current pain is not associated with diaphoresis, does not radiate to his arm, neck or jaw. He does not report dysphagia, or trouble walking. Patient states that at baseline he can walk for as far as the eye can see, and his swims quite regularly. He has had a nuclear exercise stress test in [**2134**] when his complaint of rib pain was further evaluated, At peak exercise (mid Stage 2 onset) there was 3.0-3.5 mm of gradual upsloping, horizontal ST segment depression noted in V4-V6 and inferiorly. In recovery (minute 1 onset) these ST depressions became diffusely downsloping before resolving gradually with rest by minute 10. Of note, the exercise induced ST depressions were noted in the setting of baseline prominent voltage in the absence of strain. Appropriate hemodynamic response to physiologic stress. IMPRESSION; Marked ischemic EKG changes in the setting of prominent voltage. No anginal symptoms. On nuclear report the following findings were identified: 1. Mild reversible perfusion defect involving inferolateral wall. 2. Normal left ventricular size, EF 48%. . In the ED, initial vitals were 98.6-74-140/80-14-99%2L  . Labs were significant for  Trop neg x 1. Concern is \\\"high risk\\\" so getting admitted.  CXR without acute process.  Gave ASA 325 mg. . EKG in the ED: Sinus at 52, 1st degree AV block, ST elevations in V2, V3 . On arrival to the floor, patient was complaining of mild back pain with movement, but otherwise had no complaints. His vitals were 97.7-140/93-58-18-95% . REVIEW OF SYSTEMS On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of systems were negative. .

She had 2 embryos implanted on Monday in her first cycle of IVF. She had ongoing abdominal pain since the Friday before and had been seen at [**Hospital6 33**] although it is not clear what happened there. On the morning of admission she started feeling short of breath, cough, and pleuritic chest pain that radiated to her back. She took two puffs of her ProAir which did not significantly help. Her shortness of breath got worse and so she called EMS.  When EMS arrived they administered an epi pen, nebulizers and magnesium given concern for an allergic reaction or asthma. At the outside hospital they started her on steroids. They also did a CT chest w/contrast to rule out a dissecting aortic aneurysm given her description of the pain. The timing of the contrast however was unable to evaluate for a PE. An ABG at OSH showed a respiratory alkalosis. She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further workup.  On arrival at [**Hospital1 18**] she was breathing in the 60s and noted to be very anxious. She had an expiratory wheeze that was felt to be forced due to her tachypnia.

On [**2120-5-31**], she suffered an L1 burst fracture and left rib fracture secondary to a fall from a ten foot ladder (per patient) or from a second-floor window (per patient's daughter) at home. She was initially seen at an outside hospital two days later, after the incident.  She was transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] immediately for surgical intervention.  She had a relatively uneventful perioperative course except for one unit of packed red blood cell transfusion postoperatively.  She had a total L1 vertebrectomy, fusion and segmental instrumentation of T12 to L3, cage placement at L1, and autograft during the first surgery.  She was evaluated by Psychiatry at that time for possible paranoia and questionable suicidal ideation postoperatively. Medical workup at that time included a negative RPR, normal thyroid function tests, and a head MRI showing possible chronic microvascular ischemia.  She was sent to a rehabilitation facility on [**2120-6-7**], in stable condition.  About one month later, on [**2120-7-9**], she was readmitted for elective second operation to correct kyphoscoliosis.  Again she had an uneventful operative course.  The second operation included a posterior fusion of T9 to L3, multiple thoracolumbar laminectomies, segmental instrumentation of T9 to L3, and right iliac crest graft. Postoperatively, however, she suddenly decompensated in the Post-Anesthesia Care Unit while she was receiving a transfusion of one unit of packed red blood cells.  She complained of sudden onset of chest pain and shortness of breath with oxygen saturations dropping to 70%, blood pressure dropping to 70/40.  She was intubated immediately, and transferred to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit for further management.  Progressive loss of bilateral translucency on chest x-ray and positive anti-HLA and anti-granulocyte antibodies on hematological workup were all consistent with TRALI (transfusion-associated lung injury). While in the Surgical Intensive Care Unit, her postoperative course was further complicated with methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus bacteremia, pneumonia, and wound infection (which were documented with positive cultures on [**7-17**]).   These events eventually led to a prolonged intubation.  After she was started on intravenous oxacillin on [**7-20**], she had very good response, with decreased fever and decreased white blood cell count, as well as clearing of bacteremia which was documented by several blood cultures drawn on later days.  She also underwent incision and drainage of posterior wounds on [**7-23**].  Wound cultures showed decreased colonization of methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus and rare colonies of E. coli.  She also had a diagnostic pleural tap on [**7-26**] for persistent left pleural effusion.  The final culture was negative.  She had repeated TTE on [**7-22**] which showed no vegetation and left ventricular ejection fraction greater than 55%.  She also had a CT of the chest, abdomen and pelvis on [**7-25**], which showed improving effusion and normal bowels with old splenic infarct.  CT angio was also performed, which showed improving atelectasis and effusion without evidence of pulmonary emboli.  She was extubated on [**7-28**], and transferred to Medicine on [**7-30**] in stable condition.\\n\\nMEDICAL HISTORY: Uterine fibroids\\n\\nMEDICATION ON ADMISSION: \\n\\nALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.\\n\\nPHYSICAL EXAM: \\n\\nFAMILY HISTORY: Schizophrenia\\n\\nSOCIAL HISTORY: Works full-time as an insurance underwriter.

He was diagnosed with PMR and started on prednisone with improvement in his symptoms. During the preceding six months, he reported a history of the generalized body pain as well as fatigue, weakness, and poor appetite. He also reported periodic fevers, drenching night sweats, and a 25-pound weight loss also over the same six months. Marked improvement of both his musculoskeletal and constitutional symptoms after prednisone treatment. He then presented to the emergency room on [**2197-7-17**] with palpitations and dizziness and was found to be in atrial fibrillation. He has had a history of PAF in the past. He was febrile to 101.6 with a heart rate of 126. CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis on showed multiple low-attenuation lesions within the liver, spleen, and kidneys with characteristics felt atypical for lymphoma. A follow-up MRI of the abdomen showed hypovascular masses in both kidneys and spleen of various sizes consistent with lymphoma. Mr. [**Known lastname **] then underwent bone marrow aspirate and biopsy on [**2197-7-26**], which showed extensive necrosis with focal involvement by a high-grade B-cell lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell type. FISH translocation was notable for c-Myc and Bcl-2 indicating a \\\"double hit\\\" lymphoma characterized by a Burkitt's-like lymphoma. . Mr. [**Known lastname **] has overall tolerated his chemotherapy relatively well. He has continued on his Fondaparinux daily when on [**2197-11-16**], he noted sudden onset sudden of a dark cover in the lower half of the visual field in his right eye, which lasted [**10-20**] minutes, then self-resolved. He presented to the emergency room for evaluation. TEE revealed thrombus at the tip of his right atrial catheter, with no PFO. Ophthalmology work up was negative and the episode was attributed to TIA with recommendation to continue fondaparinux. He was discharged on [**2197-11-18**] with no further episodes. . TREATMENT HISTORY: 1. Initiated treatment with [**Hospital1 **] chemotherapy on [**2197-7-29**] with two doses of Rituxan on [**2197-8-2**] and [**2197-8-3**]. Follow up CT imaging on [**2197-8-5**] showed stable lymphomatous lesions in the kidney, spleen, and abdominal nodes. 2. Rituxan 500 mg given on [**2197-8-10**] with a fever that evening and admission for neutropenia. During admission, noted for atrial fibrillation with RVR and was started on digoxin at 0.125 mg daily along with metoprolol 200 mg daily. 3. Readmitted on [**2197-8-18**] for his second cycle of [**Hospital1 **] chemotherapy, which was delayed for two days due to hypotension and cough. A CT of the chest showed bilateral lower lobe opacities, right greater than left, concerning for infection and he was treated with a course of Levaquin. 4. On [**2197-8-30**], received Rituxan at 375 mg/m2. 5. Follow up PET scan on [**2194-9-6**] showed no evidence for lymphoma but was notable for multiple peripheral base pulmonary opacities with rims of soft tissue density and relative central lucencies most of which were new. He underwent CT of the chest for further evaluation, which showed multiple filling defects within the segmental and subsegmental branches of the right lower lobe arteries compatible with pulmonary emboli. 6. Admitted on [**2197-9-7**] for initiation of anticoagulation with fondaparinux and began third cycle of treatment with [**Hospital1 **] on [**2197-9-8**](dose level 2) 7.

Admitted on [**2197-11-23**] for high-dose cyclophosphamide. 12. Admitted on [**2198-1-15**] for IVAC (originally admitted for high-dose MTX, but PET scan showed progressive disease). . OTHER MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, Burkitt's like with c-Myc and Bcl-2 positivity s/p [**Hospital1 **] x 5 cycles and multiple rituxan infusions. He has had recurrent disease within 2 - 3 months of his last treatment. Patient recently admitted [**Date range (3) 21959**] for CNS prophylaxis with high-dose MTX for his aggressive lymphoma. However, PET scan prior to admission was concerning for rapidly progressive disease and CT torso on admission agreed with these findings and his LDH continued to rise. He was therefore started on IVAC chemotherapy x5 days and discharged on neupogen. 2. PAF diagnosed in [**2180**] with now chronic atrial fibrillation in the past several months. He had no history of treatment with anti-arrhythmia or anticoagulation prior to his admission in [**8-/2197**], currently receiving treatment with metoprolol and digoxin. 3.

He later stated that he was not absolutely certain whether the patient actually ingested any wellbutrin and propanolol. Ultimately, the amount and combination of pills taken was unclear. The patient's longtime partner of nearly thirty years came home and found him semi-alert and called EMS immediately. . According to his partner, Mr. [**Known lastname 6418**] had been coughing/wheezing for several months now but had no complaints of fevers or chills.  He had been complaining about pain in his neck since a fall down a few stairs a few days prior to this current incident. .

He was somnolent on arrival to hospital but still responsive to tactile stimuli.  Fingerstick glucose was 140 on arrival. He quickly became hypotensive to SBP 73/47. He was given IVF x3L total. EKG was normal, without any alarming ST changes. Peripheral dopamine was started for rapid BP correction and he was intubated for hypoxia and airway protection. Toxicology consult was called and they recommended that the pressor choice be switched to Levofed. He was also given narcan x2 with no effect. Once the medication history was flushed out, he was given calcium which did increase his rate from 58 to 88 and his SBP increased by 10. He was given glucagon 1mg with no further effect. Toxicology consult recommended trying high dose glucagon 5mg and if that works, starting a glucagon gtt at 1-5mg/hr. They also recommend serial EKGs for monitoring.  He was also given Vancomycin and Ceftriaxone due to initial concern for possible sepsis. . He had chest xray which showed question widened mediastinum and patient reported some chest discomfort on arrival. CTA was done which showed normal aorta. FAST scan was done which showed no pericardial effusion, and no intra-abdominal bleeds.  CXR/CT did show bilateral infiltrates consistent with an aspiration. Hemodynamic instability was worrisome and he was transferred to the intensive care unit for close monitoring. . On arrival to the ICU he was hypoxic with O2 saturation of 85% on FIO2 of 50%, HR in 50's.  He was suctioned, ET tube pulled back 2cm and PEEP increased to 14, FIO2 to 100% with slow recovery of O2 saturation.

During workup of patient's acute renal failure at [**Hospital3 **], patient had an abdominal CT, which showed bilateral adrenal masses measuring up to 7.5 cm in AP diameter on the left and 6 cm in AP diameter on the right.  Patient was then discharged and represented for an adrenal mass biopsy on [**4-28**], and was sent back to [**Hospital1 **] Transitional Care Unit.  On [**4-29**], then patient then developed tachycardia and fever at [**Hospital3 **].  Chest x- ray was consistent with CHF.  Patient was given nitro paste and Lasix, and then became hypotensive to the 60's. Dobutamine was started at outside hospital and patient received levofloxacin for a question of UTI as well as vancomycin.  She was also given a dose of Solu-Medrol for a question of adrenal insufficiency.  Prior to Solu-Medrol administration, serum cortisol was checked at outside hospital and was low at 13.  Patient also had an aldosterone checked at that time, which was low at 3.0, normal range is 4 to 31.  Patient was started on dobutamine and dopamine at the outside hospital.  Dobutamine was then discontinued and Neo- Synephrine was started.  Patient had only received a 250 cc normal saline bolus prior to the start of pressors. Abdominal CT scan was performed, which showed no bleed.  The patient was then at this point transferred to the [**Hospital1 346**] Medical Intensive Care Unit for further management.  On arrival to the MICU, patient was on dopamine and Neo- Synephrine, and her blood pressure was 81/39, heart rate 120s, and was saturating 100 percent on nonrebreather.

He awoke and was doing some work at his desk when he leaned over to get some papers and fell to the ground secondary to left sided weakness.  He could not do anything with the left arm at all and had some movement of the left leg.  He could not bear weight on the left leg.  He lay on the ground for a few hours until his son came home and called 911.  He denied any headaches, nausea, vomiting, numbness or tingling.  He stated that he thought he had double vision intermittently, but could not be more specific.  The double image was of objects seen side to side, but he could not say if any particular direction of gaze made this worse.  He was seen in the Emergency Department by the neurology and stroke service where his exam was notable for a right gaze preference, left homonymous hemianopia versus left hemi-spacial visual neglect, a left facial droop, flaccid left arm with strength in all muscle groups except for minimal movement of the fingers and 4 to 4+/5 strength in left hip flexion and hamstrings.  There was minimal left foot dorsiflexion.  There was extinction to double .............. stimulation on the left.  An MRI revealed a 2 cm right sided basal ganglia bleed with some extension to the thalamus.  His blood pressure initially was 190/110, so he was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit for intravenous labetalol and frequent neurologic checks.  He did well over the first night with rapidly improved strength in the left arm.  He no longer had any complaints of diplopia.

ABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender, nondistended. EXTREMITIES:  Warm without cyanosis, clubbing or edema. NEUROLOGIC:  He was alert, oriented and attentive.  He was able to do the months of the year backwards without difficulty.  Language was fluent with intact naming, [**Location (un) 1131**], repetition and comprehension.  Praxis was normal and there was no right left confusion.  Cranial nerve exam:  The right pupil was 1.5 mm, left 2 mm.  Both were reactive to light. Visual fields were full, though he explores the left hemi-space less and requires encouragement to look to the left.  Extraocular movements revealed some limitation of vertical gaze with both up and down gaze.  There was some improvement to down gaze with vestibular ocular reflex (tilting head backwards).  Smooth pursuit was interrupted by saccades when pursuing to the right.  Saccadic eye movements were hypometric to the left.  There is a flattened nasolabial fold on the left.  Sensation was intact in the face.  Tongue and palate movements were normal.  Sternocleidomastoid and trapezius were full.  Bulk and tone were full.  There was a left pronator drift and isolated asterixis of the left hand, as well as occasional myoclonic movements of the left hand. Strength was [**3-12**] in the left deltoid, 5-/5 triceps, 4+/5 finger extensors and hand intrinsics.  Strength was full in the left lower extremity and muscle groups on the right were full.  Reflexes were 3+ on the left, 2+ on the right in both the arms and legs.  There was a withdrawal response to plantar stimulation with the left foot, but right plantar reflex was flexor.  Pinprick was mildly decreased in a patchy distribution over the left arm and leg.  Joint position sense was intact throughout.  Vibration was decreased to the knees bilaterally.  Rapid alternating movements and fine finger movements were slow on the left.  There was some dysmetria out of proportion to weakness with finger to nose testing on the left arm.  MRI revealed acute hemorrhage in the right basal ganglia extending into the thalamus.  There was changes of small vessel disease.  There was absence of flow signal in the right intracranial internal carotid artery with markedly diminished flow signal within the right middle cerebral and anterior cerebral arteries.\\n\\nFAMILY HISTORY: \\n\\nSOCIAL HISTORY: More than 50 pack year smoker, drinks one to two cans of beer per day, works as a doorman a few days per week and lives with his wife.

The patient reported that, over the past three to four weeks, he had been experiencing chest pressure while playing volleyball.  He also noted once, while carrying boxes up and down the stairs, he had anginal type symptoms that relented after stopping exertion.  He denied any chest discomfort at rest, however.  The patient was referred to Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] for a stress test on [**2132-10-22**].  He exercised for approximately five minutes on [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] protocol and had 3 to [**Street Address(2) 45253**] depression and chest pain.  His blood pressure dropped from 160 systolic to 100 systolic and was therefore referred for cardiac catheterization to further evaluate this.  At the time of cardiac catheterization on [**2132-10-22**], the catheterization showed severe three vessel disease, including a totally occluded left anterior descending artery in a diabetic, with a normal left ventricular ejection fraction.  The patient likely require revascularization versus percutaneous intervention given the fact that his left anterior descending artery, right coronary artery and left circumflex were all involved.  With diabetes, his mortality benefit was much greater with coronary artery bypass grafting, particularly in the setting of three vessel disease and left internal mammary artery replacing his left anterior descending artery lesion would give him an excellent revascularization potential.  The left main coronary artery was not obstructed.  The left anterior descending artery was totally occluded proximally, filled back to the proximal left anterior descending artery via collaterals from the right coronary artery.  The left circumflex was not obstructed.  The obtuse marginal one had an 80% proximal stenosis, obtuse marginal two had an 80% mid-vessel stenosis and the right coronary artery had an 85% to 90% mid-vessel lesion.  The right coronary artery filled with the left anterior descending artery back to its proximal aspect by right-to-left collaterals.  The patient was therefore admitted on [**2132-10-23**] and was seen by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 70**], who stated that the patient was an excellent candidate for coronary artery bypass grafting.  The patient's preoperative hematocrit was 42.5, BUN and creatinine 15 and 1.2, and INR 0.76.  His chest x-ray showed no acute cardiopulmonary disease.  Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm, no Q waves, and no ST-T segment changes were noted at this time.\\n\\nMEDICAL HISTORY: 1.  Noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus times three years.  2.

The patient was in her usual state of health until one day prior to admission when she began experiencing chest pain and shortness of breath.  The patient took 10 sublingual nitroglycerin tablets for chest pain.  She went to [**Hospital6 4299**] where was intubated and started on intravenous nitroglycerin, heparin, and given Lasix and levofloxacin.  A chest computed tomography was done to rule out dissection and was negative.  The patient became hypotensive with nitroglycerin, so she was switched to nitroglycerin paste. her first set of cardiac enzymes was negative.  An electrocardiogram revealed a left bundle-branch block (which was old).  An arterial blood gas revealed a pH of 7.33, a PCO2 of 41, and a PO2 of 185 on an FIO2 of 1.  A computed tomography scan showed bilateral pleural effusions with a pericardial effusion and a thoracic aortic aneurysm.  The chest x-ray showed left lower lobe and left lingular collapse.  The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] for a bronchoscopy.  On arrival, the patient's vital signs were stable.  A bronchoscopy was performed which showed moderate secretions in the posterior right lower lobe and a left upper and left lower lobe obstruction by a mucous plug. The mucous plug was aspirated, and a repeat chest film showed re-inflation of the lung.  A bronchoalveolar lavage specimen showed 2+ polymorphonuclear lymphocytes and no organisms.  The patient was initially hypertensive on admission.  She was given fluids and Lopressor.  She then experienced transient hypotension which led to an emergent echocardiogram which showed 4-chamber enlargement, severely depressed left ventricular function with an ejection fraction of 20%, a large pleural effusion, and a moderate pericardial effusion without echocardiogram evidence of tamponade.  There was also severe aortic insufficiency, mild mitral regurgitation, and mild tricuspid regurgitation, with a dilated aortic root.  The patient ruled in for a myocardial infarction by cardiac enzymes with a peak troponin of 0.83, and a heparin drip was started.  The patient then developed hematuria, and as the troponin leak was thought to be due to demand ischemia the heparin was dropped.  The patient's respiratory status improved, and the patient was extubated and transferred to the floor.  The patient had been hypertensive and was treated with hydralazine.  Initially, the patient's ACE inhibitor was held for acute renal failure.\\n\\nMEDICAL HISTORY: 1.  Coronary artery disease. 2.

He was admitted on [**2191-8-12**] after a fall resulting in acute on chronic SDH on the left; his course is complicated by seizure and he has been started on fosphenytoin & phenytoin.  This evening he was noted to be in acute respiratory distress with desats to the low to mid 90's on 3LNC (reportedly desatting to the mid 70's on room air; has had a variable O2 requirement since being admitted).  His blood pressure dropped to the 70's systolic and was responsive to the 80's and then 100's after a 250 cc NS bolus.  he was febrile to 101.9.  The neurology and medicine MERIT teams were concerned for an aspiration event vs. volume overload vs. PE.  CXR is c/w volume overload; however it is grossly unchanged from earlier films.  His normal schedule is M-W-F though he did not get dialyzed on Friday [**8-19**] because he was having focal motor seizures.  He was last dialyzed Saturday [**2191-8-20**] for a shorter cycle b/c of low blood flow from the HD catheter(per renal note).  His mental status has been poor since being in the hospital.  Of note, on arrival to MICU pt was being treated with vanco/gent for a possible line infection given recent fevers.  Nothing has grown out of numerous blood cultures since [**2191-8-12**] yet he continues to spike.  he was briefly in MICU green on [**8-17**] - [**8-18**] for fevers and hypotension to the 70's.

The pain became increasingly more severe and erythema began to spread. On presentation in the emergency room the patient was profoundly tachycardic with significant amounts of cellulitis without crepitance in his right thigh. There was an area of prominence near his perineum which was concerning. However, there was no evidence of any gas within the tissue. The area did not appear to involve the rectum. The patient was treated aggressively with intravenous fluid hydration, intravenous antibiotics and the patient was observed to see if his cellulitis would decrease. This was observed for several hours and the cellulitis indeed on the outer thigh did improve. However, upon serial examinations there appeared to be an area near his middle inner thigh close to the inguinal ligament that remained persistently erythematous and persistently tender.

A hip CT was notable for a fracture of the superior ramus and acetabulum. She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for management of her hip fracture.  She was initially on the medicine service but was stable and was transferred to orthopedics for definitive operative management.  Pre-operatively she was briefly hypotensive in the setting of narcotics for pain, and responded well to IVF and 3 units PRBCs.  She underwent right acetabular ORIF on [**2140-6-19**] and [**2140-6-22**]. Post-operatively, her course was complicated by UTI s/p cipro, and CHF.  She required a left CVL for access which was subsequently removed and was replaced by a left sided PICC line.

The patient presented to an outside hospital with rectal bleeding and chest pain on [**8-25**].  Baseline hematocrit is approximately 35%.  Cardiac enzymes were negative.  Rectal bleeding was stopped.  She was treated with aspirin, iron and Metamucil.  Colonoscopy done previously on [**2152-8-21**] showed diverticulosis and internal hemorrhoids. Diagnostic catheterization done on [**8-25**] at outside hospital showed three vessel coronary artery disease.  The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for intervention.  In the catheterization laboratory the patient had an episode of chest pain, which was relieved with sublingual nitroglycerin with evidence of ST depressions on her electrocardiogram.  Angiography showed diffuse disease of the right coronary artery and total occlusion of the mid right coronary artery and 90% stenosis of the left anterior descending coronary artery and discreet lesions in the obtuse marginal one.  Her distal left anterior descending coronary artery demonstrated TIMI three flow without significant obstructive disease.  Three overlapping stents were placed in the mid left anterior descending coronary artery with no residual stenosis.  Obtuse marginal one had one stent placed with no residual stenosis and the right coronary artery lesion had evidence of collaterals, therefore no stent was placed.  In the Coronary Care Unit the patient was somewhat somnolent, admitted to chest pain for the past three weeks prior to admission relieved with sublingual nitroglycerin. On her recent admission to the outside hospital for bleeding she states she was washing dishes and noted a pool of bright red blood on the floor.

She is SOB after walking 40 feet, climbing one flight of stairs and carrying in empty trash cans from the curb, none of these activities bothered her over the summer. She denies chest pain and resting SOB. She has mild swelling in the ankles d/t a broken ankle a long time ago. Cardiac catheterization on [**10-31**] confirmed severe AS with mean gradient of 32 mmHg and [**Location (un) 109**] of 0.73 cm2. Selective coronary angiography showed a right dominant system. There was no true left main coronary artery as the left coronary ostium only supplied the left anterior descending artery. The left anterior descending artery had angiographic evidence of a 40% stenosis in the proximal vessel. The left circumflex artery arose from a separate ostium at the right aortic valve cusp. This ostium is separate from the RCA ostium, but connectsvertically to the ostium of the RCA. The left circumflex artery does not have angiographic evidence of coronary artery disease in the proximal segment. There is angiographic evidence of 40-50% in-stent restenosis in the mid-LCX. The right coronary artery had a proximal [**Doctor Last Name 45655**] crook with a 40% stenosis. There was no evidence of significant flow limiting stenosis in the mid or distal RCA. Left ventriculography revealed mildly depressed left ventricular systolic function. There was severe hypokinesis/akinesis of the lateral and inferiobasal walls. There was mild global hypokinesis elsewhere.

He was diagnosed with PMR and started on prednisone with improvement in his symptoms. During the preceding six months, he reported a history of shoulder, neck and quadriceps pain as well as fatigue, weakness and poor appetite. He reported periodic fevers, drenching night sweats and a 25-pound weight loss also over the same six months. With initiation of his prednisone at 20 mg daily, he noted marked improvement of both his musculoskeletal and constitutional symptoms. He then presented to the emergency room on [**2197-7-17**] with palpitations and dizziness and was found to be in atrial fibrillation. He had a history of PAF in the past. He was febrile to 101.6 with a heart rate of 126. CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis on [**2197-7-19**] showed multiple low-attenuation lesions within the liver, spleen, and kidneys. On [**2197-7-20**], MRI of the abdomen showed hypovascular masses in both kidneys and spleen of various sizes consistent with lymphoma. A CT-guided biopsy of the spleen on [**2197-7-21**] was nondiagnostic. Mr. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] bone marrow aspirate and biopsy on [**2197-7-26**], which showed extensive necrosis with focal involvement by high-grade B-cell lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell type. FISH translocation was notable for c-Myc and Bcl-2 indicating a \\\"double hit\\\" lymphoma characterized by a Burkitt's-like lymphoma. He then began chemotherapy. . TREATMENT HISTORY: -- Initiated treatment with Dose-adjusted [**Hospital1 **] chemotherapy on  [**2197-7-29**] with two doses of Rituxan on [**2197-8-2**] and [**2197-8-3**]. Follow up CT imaging on [**2197-8-5**] showed stable lymphomatous lesions in the kidney, spleen, and abdominal nodes.  -- Rituxan 500 mg given on [**2197-8-10**] with a fever that evening  and admission for neutropenia. During admission, noted for atrial fibrillation with RVR and was started on digoxin at 0.125  mg daily along with metoprolol 200 mg daily. -- Readmitted on [**2197-8-18**] for his second cycle of [**Hospital1 **] chemotherapy, which was delayed for two days due to hypotension  and cough. A CT of the chest showed bilateral lower lobe opacities, right greater than left, concerning for infection and he was treated with a course of Levaquin. -- On [**2197-8-30**], received Rituxan at 375 mg/m2. -- Follow up PET scan on [**2197-9-6**] showed no evidence for lymphoma but was notable for multiple peripheral base pulmonary  opacities with rims of soft tissue density and relative central  lucencies most of which were new. He [**Year (4 digits) 1834**] CT of the chest for further evaluation, which showed multiple filling defects within the segmental and subsegmental branches of the right lower lobe arteries compatible with pulmonary emboli. -- Admitted on [**2197-9-7**] for initiation of anticoagulation with  fondaparinux and began third cycle of treatment with [**Hospital1 **] on [**2197-9-8**](dose level 2). -- Received Rituxan 375 mg/m2 on [**2197-9-25**]. -- Admitted on [**2197-9-29**] for fourth cycle of treatment with [**Hospital1 **](dose level 3). -- Received Rituxan 375 mg/m2 on [**2197-10-17**]. -- Admitted on [**2197-10-20**] for fifth cycle of treatment with [**Hospital1 **](dose level 3 with Adriamycin at dose level 2. Received Rituxan on [**2197-11-7**]. -- FDG tumor imaging on [**2197-10-19**] showed no evidence for lymphoma with slight interval decrease in size in bilateral pulmonary infarcts. Focal uptake in the posterior left kidney appears parenchymal, but may be within the collecting system and  projecting over the kidney due to misregistration. Focal FDG uptake in the left ischial tuberosity, without corresponding lytic or sclerotic lesion. Bone marrow biopsy showed no evidence  for lymphoma and no cytogenetic abnormalities, particularly no c-Myc or Bcl2 translocation. Note was made of hypercellular marrow with maturing trilineage hematopoiesis. -- Admitted on [**2197-11-16**] with sudden onset of a dark cover in the lower half of the visual field in his right eye, which lasted 10-15 minutes, then self-resolved. He was evaluated by Neurology and Ophthalmology. TEE revealed thrombus at the tip of his right atrial catheter, with no PFO. Ophthalmology work up was negative and the episode was attributed to possible TIA. Discharged on [**2197-11-18**] to continue his fondaparinux. -- Admitted on [**2197-11-23**] for high dose Cytoxan for stem cell mobilization. -- Attempted stem cell collections with yield ~ 0.5 CD 34 cels after 4 collections with slow recovery of counts. Collections stopped. -- Repeat PET imaging on [**2197-12-19**] showed new focal mild FDG-avidities in the mediastinal region. Interval worsening of FDG-avidity in the soft tissue immediately medial to the left acetabulum. Persistent FDG-avidity in the left ischial tuberosity, without CT correlate. -- Repeat bone marrow biopsy on [**2197-12-20**] showed no evidence for lymphoma with some dyspoiesis noted. No cytogenetic abnormalities, specifically no evidence for MDS. -- Initiated 4 weeks of Rituxan on [**2197-12-26**]. -- Noted slight increase in LDH to ~ 260. Repeat CT of the torso on [**2198-1-3**] showed left pelvic soft tissue and expansion of the left piriformis muscle corresponding to the regions of FDG avidity for [**2197-12-19**] scan. Small internal mammary and left  juxtaclavicular lymph nodes corresponding to foci of FDG avidity. Decreased size of lymphomatous renal lesions compared to [**2197-7-6**] with stable small retroperitoneal lymph nodes. Continued evolution of pulmonary infarcts. No definite bony lesions, though there is slightly lucency in the left acetabulum in a region of FDG avidity. . Other Past Medical History: s/p RLL lobectomy in [**2198-2-6**] secondary to PNA #. PAF diagnosed in [**2180**] with now chronic atrial fibrillation in the past several months. He had no history of treatment with anti-arrhythmia or anticoagulation prior to his admission in [**8-/2197**], currently receiving treatment with metoprolol and digoxin. #. Pulmonary embolism, fondaparinux on hold due to thrombocytopenia #. Polymyalgia rheumatica diagnosed in [**2197**] and managed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], although further treatment on hold while getting treatment for lymphoma and unclear if his symptoms were related to lymphoma and not PMR. #.

Patient had bilateral movement of her extremities at the scene, blood on her face. Found face down on the floor apparently moving all extremities equally at the scene, but intubated for airway protection. Was taken to [**Hospital6 3426**] where head CT showed a small subdural hematoma on the right. Patient was given Ativan 2 mg and then loaded with IV Dilantin.  Past medical history of hypertension, asthma, ankle fracture in [**2198-12-15**].  On exam, her temperature was 98.9, heart rate 77, BP 131- 181/60-111. Patient was vented. She was intubated and sedated. HEENT: She had racoon eyes. Neck: She was in a C. collar. Cardiovascular: Irregular rhythm. Pulmonary: Breath sounds clear throughout. Abdomen: Soft, nontender, nondistended. Extremities: No clubbing, cyanosis, or edema. Neurologically: Sedated, not alert. Pupils: 2 mm and briskly reactive. She has positive corneals, positive gag. Face is symmetric. Minimal withdraw to noxious stimulation in all four extremities.  Head CT shows right frontoparietal subdural 9 mm at its maximum thickness along the surface of the right frontal area. No midline shift and no mass effect.  Patient was admitted to the ICU for close neurologic observation. Blood pressure was kept less than 140, and she was q.1h. neuro checks. INR less than 1.3. In speaking with the family on [**2199-4-23**], it was the family's wish that the patient become made DNR/DNI.  On [**4-24**], the patient was extubated, and successfully and verbally following commands. Platelet count was low at 81, and she was transfused with platelets. Patient was evaluated by cardiology for her Afib. They recommended rate control, a surface echocardiogram, keeping her electrolytes within normal limits, keeping her heart rate in the 60 range.  EEG was done, which just showed encephalopathy. The patient had repeat head CT which was stable.  On [**2199-4-25**], she was transferred to the step-down unit. She remained awake, alert, following commands, and moving all extremities. On [**2199-4-26**], the patient had episode of nonsustained V-tach. Patient ruled out for a MI. Cardiology was notified. She continued to have some episodes of respiratory distress requiring some Lasix for CHF and also increasing heart rate with episodes of rapid Afib.  Cardiology was reconsulted, and her Lopressor was increased. She was loaded with digoxin. She was seen by cardiology for possible cardioversion if rate control was not obtained. She remained neurologically opening her eyes briefly, following commands intermittently, verbalizing her name. Patient was seen by speech and swallow for possible PEG, although patient did not respond well to swallow testing. They did feel that with a couple of more days, before mental status improves, she may be able to generate a swallow without aspiration. Currently, she is at high aspiration risk and requires a feeding tube in place.  Her vital signs have remained stable. She has been afebrile. She did have an induced sputum sent on [**2199-4-24**] that showed gram-negative rods. Although she has an allergy to penicillin, sensitivities on the sputum were performed. Currently, Bactrim sensitivity is still pending. The patient's vital signs have remained stable, and she is currently afebrile, and she was transferred to the medical service on [**2199-4-29**].

Since then, she has had palpitations in the setting of chemotherapy, and over the past years has had no more than [**3-2**] episodes per year. However, on the day of her most recent cystoscopy on [**3-5**] at [**Hospital1 69**], she experienced a tachycardia, which was terminated after she received intravenous Lopressor. The same tachycardia occurred on [**3-9**] for which she presented to [**Hospital6 17032**] Emergency Room, where the tachycardia was terminated with intravenous adenosine. The tracings of the tachycardia were reviewed by her Electrophysiologist, Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) 1911**], and thought be a narrow complex tachycardia at 150 beats/minute with an RP interval of 100-120 msec. However, immediately post adenosine, there was evidence of sinus rhythm with a fully pre-excited QRS complex consistent with a left lateral bypass tract. Since the Emergency Room visit, she has been on low-dose atenolol without further recurrences of the arrhythmia. Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) 26676**] recommended EPS with ablation and the patient was admitted today for the procedure. . During the procedure she developed hypotension to SBP of 77 mm HG.  This responded to IVF and dopamine infusion to SBP of 130s.  Patient was mentating appropriately.  Focal views of TTE showed noncircumferential pericardial effusion with mild RA collapse without RV collapse.  Her heparin was reversed with protamine. PA catheterization showed preserved CO, no equalization of filling pressures, and preserved Y descent on RA tracing.  This suggested nonhemodynamically significant effusion.

His PCO2 is normally in the 60s (per OMR) but were worse on admission (103). Per caretaker, the patient has been having steadily increasing O2 requirements over the last 6 weeks and has not been able to perform his usual activities. He is normally on 2L Nasal O2 at home with O2 sats 98-100%. During the week before admission, he required 4L O2 to keep O2 sats above 90%. He was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 **] for multifocal PNA in [**6-19**]. . Per caretaker, the patient has been complaining of cough over the last week. The patient is mostly non-verbal. He can utter short phrases, but is NOT TO BE TAKEN at face value, i.e., when offered food, he may say he is not hungry even though he has not eaten that day. He is able to vocalize pain and discomfort with pointing. He is ambulatory (with assistance) at baseline and is normally incontinent of urine and stool. . He presented to the ED on [**2204-9-1**] with HR=120s, BP=140/70, RR=24, 96% on 2L. ABG showed pH=7.34, pC02=103, pO2=79. CTA showed worsening volume loss of right lung and left-sided pulmonary edema with possible multifocal infection. He was given ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and vancomycin. He was admitted directly to the ICU for further management. In the ICU, he had episodes of desaturation to the mid-50s; these improved rapidly with face mask and nebulizer treatment. He did not require intubation. His antibiotics were changed to levofloxacin and Unasyn for treatment of pneumonia. Repeat ABGs showed improvement in pC02 and p02, and he was transferred to the floor for further management. He was then transferred to the floor. . On the floor this morning at approximately 4:30 am, he was found to be acutely agitated, he had removed his oxygen and was desaturating into the teens - he became cyanotic and unresponsive. A gas shortly after this revealed a pco2 of 109 - up from his baseline of pCo2 of 60. On replacing his oxygen by face mask (100%), he recovered his sats, his color, and his responsiveness. He is transferred to the MICU for continual O2 monitoring. . PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Mitochondrial enzyme deficiency causing mental and developmental retardation.

The patient was admitted to [**Hospital **] Hospital on [**5-4**] requesting detoxification as he started using IV drugs again.  He had not been compliant with his medications, including his coumadin.  He was found to have a subclavian DVT and a left brachial arterial aneurysm, which was thought to be secondary to injection of IV drugs.  Vascular evaluated the patient and recommended the patient be fully sober before any attempt at aneurysm repair. He was placed on a heparin gtt and transitioned to coumadin. He had an elevated WBC there and was febrile so he was started in azithromycin with improvement in both.  However, on [**5-8**], he became agitated and left the hospital AMA.  He returned to the ED on [**5-9**] and reported chest pain radiating to the left arm, headache, photophobia (no rigidity) and shortness of breath.  He reported using cocaine since his discharge and denied use of EtOH. . While there, he was found to be febrile with increasing shortness of breath.  TTE negative for vegetations and blood culture with no growth at the time of transfer.  CXR with no clear consolidation and he was scheduled to undergo a TEE to rule out endocarditis but the patient started withdrawing right before the procedure.  He was given suboxone.  Later on during the hospitalization, he was found to have a dense aphasia and left hemiplegia.  Neurology was consulted and felt this could be secondary to meningitis vs embolic events.  CT scan demonstrated poor definition of perimesencephalic cisterns without asymmetry which was concerning for some increased intracranial pressure. There was evidence of treated AVM with no other signs of acute or evolving territorial infarct.  Patient was started on a heparin gtt for presumed embolic event. . Given the concern for meningitis, he was also treated with vancomycin, ceftriaxone and gentamycin.  His mental status remained altered.  In addition, his respiratory status worsened requiring intubation on evening [**5-16**].  CXR did not reveal a clear consolidation and he had elevated A-a gradient so he underwent a CTA which did not reveal a PE.   His mental status did not improve and his respiratory status worsened.  He continued on a heparin drip.  A CTA was negative for PE. He was intubated and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**5-17**] for further w/u. .

Patient was recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] on [**9-20**] after undergoing stent placement in the left mainstem bronchus and Y stent placement in the trachea. . Patient initially presented to OSH in respiratory distress and was found to have an anterior mediastinal mass on CXR, confirmed by CT. Patient continued to desat from 80s to low 50s and was eventually intubated. Patient was transfered to [**Hospital1 2177**] on [**2171-7-22**] per request of family. According to family, patient was in his usual state of health until he started to have generalized symptoms 6 months prior to presentation to OSH including sore throat, cough, and respiratory symptoms. Patient had been treated for 2 weeks for bronchitis without resolution. . At [**Hospital1 2177**], patient was intially intubated with double lumen ETT for acute respiratory distress. Patient had multiple episodes of desaturation requiring intervention with bronchoscopy for better ETT positioning. On bronchoscopy, the anterior mass was noticed to cause tracheal narrowing and obstruction of the mainstem bronchi bilaterally. Patient's double lumen ETT was changed to a single lumen on [**7-26**] for better ventilation. Course complicated by bilateral pneumothoraces requiring bilateral chest tube placement which were d/c'ed on [**8-24**] and [**8-25**]. Patient was extubated on [**8-23**] but reintubation on [**8-30**] due to hypercarbic respiratory failure. He was transferred at this time to [**Hospital1 18**] for Y stent placement and then transferred back to [**Hospital1 2177**]. He was extubated on [**9-21**] and initially did well but could not adequately handle the secretions so he was taken to the OR on [**9-27**] for tracheostomy by ENT. The procedure was technically difficult since the Y stent was too high. He was reintubated (nasotracheal tube) in OR with bronchoscopy to remove mucous plugging in right middle and lower lobes. . He underwent an ultrasound guided biopsy of his anterior mediastinal mass on [**7-23**]. Given elevated AFP (4093 on [**7-23**]) and biopsy of undifferentiated carcinoma, patient was treated for germ cell tumor with neoadjuvant cisplatin and etoposide from [**Date range (1) 73635**]. Patient prophylaxed for TLS with alopurinol, dexamethasone, and IV fluids. Chemotherapy complicated by pancytopenia and neutropenic fever, requiring PRBC transfusions on Neupogen. Cycle 2 of chemotherapy delayed due to development of Pseudomonas sepsis and ARF. However, with stabilization, patient underwent cycle 2 of carboplatinum and etoposide on [**8-4**]. At the time of transfer, patient is reportedly at his chemo-induced neutropenic nadir. However, Hct and platelets have been stable. . From an ID perspective, following cycle 1 of chemotherapy, patient was diagnosed with a VAP on [**7-28**] and was started on vancomycin and cefepime. Both were continued with the addition of fluconazole for neutropenic precautions following chemotherapy. Cefepime was changed to Zosyn when patient's sputum culture was (+) for Achromobacter on [**8-7**]. Patient then developed an abscess in his R groin at the site of a prior line which was I&Ded by surgery on [**8-16**] and was also the source of the above mentioned MDR pseudomonas sepsis. Patient had pseudomonas in blood, urine, and R groin abscess cultures. He completed a 15 day course of gentamicin and cefepime, despite nephrotoxicity as pseudomonas in wound culture was only sensitive to Gentamicin. Patient was then started on Vancomycin due to MRSA from R quinton tip culture. Also started on Amikacin for Pseudomonas in sputum and urine. Diarrhea started on [**8-17**]. C diff was negative x 3 and was thought to be secondary to chemotherapy. He was placed on empiric Flagyl at this time. A CT scan was obtained on [**9-15**] showing ileocecal thickening and ? typhlitis (necrotizing enterocolitis) as well as some ? intusseception fo ascending colon, although there was no evidence of obstruction. Patient then had temp spike through above broad antibiotic coverage and empiric caspofungin started on [**9-15**]. With persisting fevers patient was continued on Cefepime, Amikacin, for pseudomonas in sputum and urine. . [**Hospital **] hospital course was also complicated by ARF thought to be secondary to pseudomonas sepsis and hypotension on [**8-8**]. Patient developed poor UOP and lasix gtt started with poor response. Patient eventually required CVVH for volume overload on [**8-11**] with 6L removal, and on [**8-15**] with 4L removal. R Quinton placed in R IJ and patient was started on HD on [**8-17**]. Quinton eventually clotted on [**8-25**] and he recent emergent dialysis through a newly placed left femoral line. He then went to IR for possible L quinton placement for HD, but was discovered to have bilat DVTs in IJs which prevented placement. He eventually responded to 140 mg IV lasix with good UOP on [**8-29**] and the L femoral line was d/c'ed to prevent further infection. ARF eventually resolved with normal Cr and good UOP.\\n\\nMEDICAL HISTORY: # Germ cell tumor in mediastinum - s/p 2 rounds of chemotherapy # pancytopenia [**3-15**] chemotherapy\\n\\nMEDICATION ON ADMISSION: Ipratropium Bromide MDI 4 PUFF IH QID Acetaminophen 650 mg PO Q6H:PRN Lansoprazole Oral Disintegrating Tab 30 mg PO DAILY Albuterol 10 PUFF IH Q4H Lorazepam 1-3 mg IV Q1H:PRN anxiety Albuterol 10 PUFF IH Q2H:PRN Metoprolol 12.5 mg PO TID Amikacin 1100 mg IV Q36H Methadone HCl 20mg PO Q8H CefePIME 2gm IV Q8H Miconazole Powder 2% 1 Appl TP TID Diazepam 10mg PO BID Nephrocaps 1 CAP PO DAILY Fentanyl Citrate 25-100 mcg/hr IV DRIP INFUSION Nystatin Oral Suspension 5 ml PO QID Haloperidol 5 mg IM Q4H:PRN agitation Olanzapine 5 mg PO DAILY Promethazine HCl 6.25 mg IV Q6H:PRN Insulin SC Sliding Scale Vancomycin 1.25gm IV Q 12H .

As you recall, he is a 30-year-old man with a history of ruptured hepatic adenomas that turned out to [**Hospital1 **] some hepatocellular carcinoma.  He is scheduled for reexcision of two adenomas that we intentionally left behind at his prior incision.  He reports he has actually been feeling quite well and that his weight has been stable.  He has had no problems with the incision itself.  He denies any nausea, vomiting, fevers, chills, chest pain, or shortness of breath.  He is moving his bowels regularly.  Medications were reviewed today and include cholestyramine, which he says he has not actually started taking as well as his scopolamine patch for his preop nausea control.  On examination today, his temperature is 98.4, heart rate 83, blood pressure 125/85.  His weight is 87.8 kilos.  He is anicteric and in no acute distress.  His lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.  His heart is regular.  His abdomen is soft and nondistended.  His incision has healed nicely without evidence of hernia.  He has no peripheral edema.  Laboratory studies from today are notable for white count of 5, hematocrit 46, and platelets of 178,000.  His INR is 1.0.  His renal function panel is entirely within normal limits with a creatinine of 0.9.  His liver function tests remain mildly elevated with an ALT of 161, AST 116, alkaline phosphatase 169, and total bilirubin of 0.6.  In summary, Mr. [**Known lastname 1637**] is a 30-year-old man with multiple hepatic adenomas, likely due to steroid ingestion.  He is scheduled for reexcision of a segment IV adenoma as well as a segment II/III adenoma.  We are hopeful that these do not [**Hospital1 **] any cancer, although as he was found to have carcinoma in his prior specimens, we feel strongly that these should be removed.

The patient had a prolonged and complicated hospital course.  He failed extubation on POD 2 and multiple times thereafter. . He had persistent leukocytosis, fevers, and diarrhea during hospitalization and was empirically treated for C. Diff with a 10-day course of vancomycin & flagyl (despite 7 negative C. Diff toxin tests). . His thoracotomy wound developed erythema and blistering and he had an incision & drainage of [**2142-3-21**] (fluid culture returned without growth).  He becam septic on [**2142-4-8**] and, in addition to persisent leukocytosis & fevers, he also became hypotensive and required pressors.  He was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics per ID recommendations. He was found to have a graft infection (noted on CT) requiring IR drainage on [**2142-4-8**]. All OR swabs were without growth. . The patient had a tracheostomy & PEG tube placed on [**2142-4-1**] for multile failed attempts at extubation. . Ultimately, his sputum was showed enterobacter; the patient was started on meropenem.  He was transferred to [**Hospital1 49145**] on [**2142-4-16**] on meropenem (course to end on [**2142-4-22**]). . On [**2142-4-24**], the patient presented to the [**Hospital3 **] from NESH with hypoxic respiratory failure with hypotension & fever to 101.3.  At that time, according to the OSH notes, he was still on meropenem and this was initially continued. In he ED he was found to have a PNA which was ultimately determined to be due to Enterobacter resistant to all tested antibiotics except tigecycline.  He initially required ventilatory support, but transitioned to trach mask on [**2142-4-30**].  He has since been stable from a hemodynamic & respiratory standpoint. . A CT chest with contrast performed (& read) at OSH demonstrated a 7 x 3.4 x 1.7 cm loculated pleural fluid collection at the lateral posterior aspect of the L lung base. . Serial chest x-rays during his admission at [**Hospital3 **] demonstrated development of a a R lower lobe PNA. . The patient has had an intermittent leukocytosis with bandemia at the [**Hospital3 **]. A tagged WBC scan was performed on [**4-30**] in an attempt to identify an infectious source.  The scan demonstrated increased update in the L chest adjacent to the aortic arch which was suspicious for a periarotic infection.  According to notes, he has been afebrile for several days but developed WBC 12.3 with 13% bands [**Last Name (un) **].    As such, the patient is being transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation and treatment. .

He has never had migraines or similar symptoms prior to this and generally does not suffer from headaches very much.  Was in his baseline state of health until monday night at 10 PM when he noted right foot numbness/weakness which advanced up to his right arm and face over a period of minutes.  2-3 hours later he had confusion and dysarthria.  He went to [**Hospital **] Hospital where he was worked up for stroke. He had a negative MRI and MRA, negative cardiac echo, and his symptoms had all resolved after about 4 hours.  As his deficits resolved a bitemporal throbbing headache set in for a period of hours.  He has never had these types of headaches in the past.

       "   \"text_a\": \"CHIEF COMPLAINT: \\n\\nPRESENT ILLNESS: Short gut syndrome, chronically occluded superior vena cava, right brachiocephalic vein and right jugular vein, occlusion of the inferior vena cava and both common iliac veins, TPN dependent.  polyposis, she had resection of her colon at age 20 and now has a high output ileostomy.  She is dependent on TPN although she can take small amounts of oral food.  Over the years, she has chronically occluded both internal jugular veins, both subclavian veins and the upper segment of the superior vena cava.  She came in [**2138-7-26**], to our attention when she had developed Staphylococcus aureus sepsis At this time, we removed a tunneled femoral catheter which had been tunneled from the right groin into the left upper chest and placed temporary access.  After clearing of the infection, we were attempting to recanalize the occluded central veins but were unsuccessful, even with a sharp recanalization technique.  On [**2138-12-9**], I then decided to place a new tunneled right femoral 7French double lumen Hickman catheter with tip at the level of L1 and the exit site over the lateral thigh.  The patient came to see on [**2139-9-7**], in clinic with the chief complaint of line dysfunction.  She had noticed some sluggishness of return during TPN infusions and then had stopped TPN and only placed hydration.  She brought a venogram from [**2139-8-26**], which demonstrated that the tip of the catheter had pulled back into the distal inferior vena cava. There was some high grade narrowing in both common iliac veins which were still patent at this time.  The inferior vena cava was not filled and there were paralumbar collaterals.  On [**2139-9-11**], she was admitted to St. [**Hospital 107**] Medical Center in [**Hospital1 189**], [**State 350**] for line sepsis, generalized weakness, near syncope and low grade fever.  She came to the [**Hospital1 69**] on [**2139-9-15**].  She presented in a severely debilitated status.  Her blood pressure was 96/54, with a pulse rate of 123, temperature 100, and oxygen saturation 99%.  The catheter over the right thigh had pulled back with the calf being outside of the skin.  There was some swelling and induration over the right thigh extending to the level of the knee which was suggestive of deep venous thrombosis but additional superinfection and cellulitis could not be ruled out.   The lungs were clear. The abdomen was soft.  There was an intact left lower quadrant ileostomy.  The heart rate was regular and considering the rate, murmurs could not be elicited.  To assess her semi-obtunded status, blood was drawn which revealed a severe hypomagnesemia with a level of 0.7 and a hematocrit of 26.6.  She received an infusion of Magnesium. Because of an antibody to the blood, blood was ordered but couldn't be transfused before the start of the procedure. To reduce further risks of sepsis due to the line, we proceeded with recanalization of the inferior vena cava.  Because of the patient's low pain threshold, all procedures had to be performed under MAC anesthesia.  I removed the tunneled right femoral line and replaced it with a 7French bright tip sheath.  I also gained access through the left femoral vein. It was possible to recanalize both iliac veins and the chronically occluded inferior vena cava.  Infusion catheters were placed and TPA was infused for the remainder of the day and of the night.  On [**2139-9-16**], the patient returned to the angiography suite in the morning.  Some interval lysis had occurred.  The TPA infusion was continued until the afternoon.  In the meantime, she had been transfused with two units of packed red blood cells and her hematocrit had reached 30.0.  In the afternoon, I was able to dilate the occluded inferior vena cava and place kissing stents in the chronic occlusion channels of the inferior vena cava.  Stents were also extended into both common iliac veins and the adjacent segments of the external iliac veins.  The patient was heparinized overnight.  The next morning a follow-up was done which demonstrated that the left sided system was still open.  On the right side, a separation between the caval and the iliac stent had occurred and the inferior stent had moved slightly laterally.  The main goal for this day's procedure was to give the patient also a superior vena cava access since it became clear that she would be having recurrent infections in the long run. The main treatment goal was to provide for the future three access sites: one for a tunneled line, one for a temporary line should the permanent one become infected and needs pulling, and a 3rd for a new tunneled line, considering this patient is life- long tpn. She was controlled with Vancomycin.  Her levels on the one gram per day regimen was what she came from the outside revealed a Vancomycin random level of 40. With input from infectious diseases consult over the next days, appropriate Vancomycin regimen was obtained.  On [**2139-9-17**], I then undertook sharp recanalization of the superior vena cava through a right internal jugular approach by placing a snare into the superior vena cava as a target.  It was possible to recanalize the internal jugular, brachiocephalic, and superior vena cava with stents and  place a temporary double lumen catheter.  In the same session, I also repaired the separated caval stent by placing of an additional briding stent. By the next morning, the patient remained heparinized.  She had some oozing around the right neck exit site.  I had removed the femoral access on the evening before to reduce the overall risk of infection.  We had obtained cultures from the tip of the previously indwelling tunneled catheter and blood cultures were obtained.  There was no growth to date. A regimen with one gram Vancomycin every eighteen hours was then achieved with appropriate trough levels.  Ultimately, the right internal jugular line was exchanged for a tunneled 7French double lumen Angiodynamics catheter of 57 centimeter length.  The tip was placed into the superior vena cava.  In the following course, the patient had only low grade temperature to 100, however, no spikes.  She was transferred to the [**Hospital1 **] from the Intensive Care Unit on [**2139-9-22**].  On [**2139-9-22**], she still had some swelling of her neck and both arms which may have been related to fluid therapy.  An ultrasound on [**2139-9-13**], demonstrated that the internal jugular vein and superior vena cava were patent compatible with a successful recanalization.  On [**2139-9-23**], the swelling had been much reduced so that now there also was a satisfying clinic result, and on [**9-24**] facies and arms were normal.  We had attempted to Coumadinize her since she had been on Coumadin on the outside.  However, because of the unreliable gastrointestinal absorption, we decided to add instead greater amounts of Heparin to her TPN and her daily infusion regimen.  Of note, her hematocrit drifted again down to 23.0% on [**2139-9-22**].  This included a blood loss of about 250 cc for all the surgical interventions.  We therefore transfused her again with two units of packed red blood cells.  From an infectious disease point, she never expressed open sepsis.  We will keep her on Vancomycin until [**2139-9-24**].  She developed an oral herpes which was treated for five days with Acyclovir.  The TPN is to be reinstituted with a nightly infusion. With hematology consult we recommend to add folate and B12. B12 may not be stable in TPN, so she may need addional injections.  We drew folate and B12 levels today. results are pending. adapted the composition to address the recurrent. Heparin in the TPN infusion bag should be increased to 8000 U per day. The daily 1 L infusion of  D5-/2NS should be supplemented with 5000 U heparin to be infused over the day. Additional fluid should not contain heparin if need for hydration in presence of a high out put ileostomy.  We also obtained hematology consultation to address the issue of recurrent bouts of anemia which the patient also had at home. This resulted in the B12 and folate additon recommendation. We also drew today Ferritin, folate, B12 and reticulocyte counts. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3060**] will follow up with outpatient consult. Recommend also bone density study because of prior hysterectomy and heparin use as well as genetic cousneling because of [**Doctor First Name **] familial inbcidence of cancer to assess for Li-Frameni BRCA. On discharge, the patient is stable.  She has no signs of acute infection.\\n\\nMEDICAL HISTORY: \\n\\nMEDICATION ON ADMISSION: \\n\\nALLERGIES: \\n\\nPHYSICAL EXAM: \\n\\nFAMILY HISTORY: \\n\\nSOCIAL HISTORY: \",\n",

       "   \"text_a\": \"CHIEF COMPLAINT: unwitnessed fall at home/[**Hospital3 **] facility, rapid heart rate\\n\\nPRESENT ILLNESS: Mrs. [**Known lastname 10528**] is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old female with PMH significant for atrial fibrillation,HTN, breast cancer (s/p mastectomy [**2049**]), hypothyroidism, who was originally admitted on [**11-28**] following an unwitnessed fall at home. Prior to ED arrival the patient had been evaluated by her PCP at her [**Hospital3 **] facility for left shoulder pain which was felt to be due to an effusion. According to patient she went into her bathroom, remembers sitting on the toilet, then she fell to the floor. She did not recall feeling lightheaded or dizzy. She denied any palpitations, chest pain, or acute onset of shortness of breath. She did not believe that she lost consciousness and could recall details of her entire fall. Patient believes she was on the floor for a few hours because she found it very difficult to pull herself up. She reported that she thought she may have hit her head and left shoulder. . In the ED her initial vitals were T 98F, HR 156, BP 160/80, RR 22, and O2 sat 95% on RA. She was found to be in rapid atrial fibrillation to the 150's and was started on a diltiazem drip with initial good effect. She received a dose of ciprofloxacin for a positive UA in the setting of a leukocytosis to 19. CT of the head and neck were negative for any fractures, and no intracranial bleeds were noted. Bilateral shoulder x-rays were negative for fractures or dislocations. . At time of arrival to the medical floor patient's rate was down to the 60's-70's. She denied any palpitations, CP or SOB. Her main complaint was left sided shoulder pain, which had been chronic for some time. She denied any recent illnesses including URI symptoms, urinary symptoms, diarrhea, nausea or vomiting. She reported poor appetite for a few days. . . On the medical floor, she subsequently had multiple triggers for atrial fibrillation with RVR. Blood cultures from admission grew GPC so she was started on Vancomycin on [**11-29**]. Due to complaints of left shoulder pain, she then underwent arthrocentesis of the left shoulder. Culture of the joint fluid ultimately yielded MSSA, as did multiple blood cultures ([**2-24**] from [**11-28**], [**12-29**] from [**11-29**], and [**12-25**] from [**11-30**]). She was seen by the cardiology service who recommended changing her from diltiazem for metoprolol. . Of note, her fluid balance remained positive throughout the beginning of her hospital course, and her weight increased from 68->73kg. Due to concern over ARF, she received IVFs and she then developed fluid overload, pulmonary edema and hypoxia which required transfer to the MICU for stabilization. Her MICU course was complicated by AFib/Flutter with RVR occasionally requiring IV nodal agents. She was aggressively diuresed in the MICU with IV furosemide and at time of transfer, her shortness of breath had abated and her oxygen saturation level was much improved to 96% on 5L NC. . Once she stabilized she was transferred to [**Hospital1 1516**]/Cardiology service for ongoing management and continued on Diltiazem drip for rate control. At time she transferred out of MICU, she was receiving Diltiazem Extended-Release 300 mg PO daily and Metoprolol Tartrate 25 mg PO TID, with additional IV agents as needed. The patient's bacteremia was felt to be related to an underlying endocarditis. Echocardiogram on [**2102-11-30**] showed EF of 70%, mild AS, and at least moderate 2+ mitral regurgitation. No comparisons existed in our system. Patient was also complaining of diffuse generalized abdominal pain that had been present for 2 days near the end of her MICU course prior to transfer to cardiology service. The patient had not had a bowel movement in about 4 days. Surgical service was called due to preliminary read on abdominal CT which showed SBO and  incarcerated right inguinal hernia which was reported to be at transition point near terminal ileum. Surgery consult called and evaluation on the floor found that hernia was reducible. Primary team placed NGT for ease of her abdominal pain and distension from SBO/ileus. Surgical options were limited due to multiple co-morbidities, especially her bacteremia, suspected endocarditis, unstable atrial fibrillation with RVR and her ongoing dyspneic episodes. This prompted multiple discussions with patient and family surrounding goals of care during the last days of her hospital course. The palliative care service had been following the case and had multiple patient/family meetings. She pulled her NGT out on two occasions and her mentation was less clear toward the end of her hospital course. She was given low doses of morphine, Tylenol, and anti-emetics for SBO-related abdominal pain control. Ultimately, the patient's family (HCP/son) asked for no additional invasive measures, especially surgery. Code status was changed to DNR/DNI, and she was soon made comfort measures only per family's wishes. Sadly, she passed away soon thereafter on the morning of [**2102-12-8**].\\n\\nMEDICAL HISTORY: -Breast Cancer, s/p L mastectomy in [**2049**] -Atrial Fibrillation, rate controlled on metoprolol, unclear if on coumadin -Hypothyroidism -Hypertension -?

She has been taking large amounts of [**First Name3 (LF) 10964**] (3.5-5gm/day) for the last two years to help alleviate her chronic abdominal pain and flank pain from pyelonephritis.  She was in her usual state of health, until approximately three weeks ago, when she presented to an OSH with abdominal pain, flank pain, vomiting, hypoglycemia, high wbc count, and dysphagia.   Six days prior to admission at [**Hospital1 18**], after spending two weeks at the OSH, she returned home with the diagnosis of viral enteritis.  Upon returning home, she developed severe right upper quadrant pain at rest that was rated a [**11-22**].  The pain was of similar quality to her previous pain at the OSH, constant, sharp, non-radiating, and increasing with palpation.  She experienced N/V (no blood) and a decreased appetite, but denied any shortness of breath, chest pain, bright red blood per rectum, or melena.  To alleviate her abdominal pain, she increased her pain medication to 10 tabs of [**Month/Year (2) 10964**] (5 gm/day) and Percocet 2 tabs q3hr (16tab x .325 = 5.2gm).

Dobutamine MIBI at that time revealed a partially reversible inferior defect without any EKG changes or symptoms during the exam. The ejection fraction at that time was 60%.  No intervention was done as patient refused and he was managed medically.  From that time he has been in his usual state of health until presenting today with a sudden squeezing sensation in his chest starting approximately 2 PM on the day of admission which was relieved with sublingual Nitroglycerin.  The patient returned approximately six hours later at which time he took another Nitroglycerin tablet and called EMS to bring him to the Emergency Department.  The chest pain was associated with nausea, diaphoresis and dizziness.  He also had worsening shortness of breath at the time.  The pain did not radiate anywhere.  In the Emergency Department, he was given Atrovent nebulizers, oxygen and sublingual Nitroglycerin times two. He was started on a heparin drip.  Shortly thereafter he was found to be in sinus bradycardia with a rate in the 30s with stable blood pressure and worsening O2 saturation to the 70s.

Family noticed an acute worsening of his symptoms on [**10-10**].  Patient's family had discontinued his Sinemet prior to him presenting in the Emergency Room.  Patient was admitted to the Neurology Service to rule out an acute stroke versus exacerbation of Parkinson's disease.  Patient was found to have new left arm and leg weakness on admission.  Patient had a CAT scan of the head done on [**10-28**] secondary to his not being able to tolerate MRI.  Patient was found to have a massive right frontotemporal parietal subdural hemorrhage with fluid level and midline shift and neurosurgery was consulted at that time.  The right subdural hemorrhage was subacute in appearance on head CT.  Patient was monitored for immediate bedside drainage of subdural hemorrhage in the Intensive Care Unit and aspirin and subcutaneous heparin were discontinued at that time.  On [**10-28**], a bedside right subdural drain was placed with good flow of subacute appearing subdural fluid at that time.

On [**10-30**], the patient was alert and oriented to person and place. EOM were full.  Patient was able to wiggle his toes.  A repeat head CT was performed that showed that the right frontal drain was in the epidural space.  There still was a significant amount of subdural component.  On the repeat head CT, the drain was readjusted, therefore, on [**10-30**], and again, good flow of hygroma subdural fluid was obtained secondary to readjustment of the drain.  On [**10-31**], patient was doing well.  No dyskinesia were noted.  There was a minimal left pronator drift.  Speech was clearer.  Subdural drain had drained about 50 cc.  CAT scan was rechecked at this time.  Subdural fluid seized to drain on [**10-31**].  Repeat CAT scan was stable.  Drain was discontinued at that time.  Patient continues to neurologically improve and was transferred to the floor on [**11-1**].  Patient still had some persistent mild left leg weakness.

He was recently finished a maintenance round of IVIG two weeks ago for gradually worsening symptoms of dysphagia and trouble chewing since this summer. He did not derive any benefit from the IVIg ,and was planning to have barium swallow study performed. He denies any symptoms of regurgitation. His dosage of Pyridostigmine has not changed recently. He was in to see his urologist on Monday for symptoms of dysuria and difficulty initiating the urine stream. Cystoscopy was performed, and note made of normal sized prostate. The urologist prescribed a medication to \\\"help relax my bladder.\\\" Solifenacin or brand name Vesicare, which notably antigonizes muscarinic Ach receptors. He took doses on Tuesday and Wednesday. He awoke today to note severely \\\"nasal\\\" sounding voice, diplopia, even worse dysphagia and difficulty chewing. Diplopia is mild, and notable in all directions, alleviated by closing one eye. He denies any difficulty breathing or c/o SOB at present. Per discussion with his wife via telephone the patient is a minimizer and only seeks care when he absolutely must. She thinks he may have confused the dosages of his medications a few weeks ago and was taking double the dose of atorvastatin.

Regarding his lymphadenopathy, he reports he began to notice swelling over his left temple about 3 weeks ago that gradually migrated down the left side of his face and behind his jaw into his neck. He reports it is mildly painful over his temple as well as over his jaw while chewing. He also affirms it is tender to palpation. He was in contact with his PCP with these findings and underwent an ultrasound followed by a CT of his head and neck. The scan revealed adenopathy extending from the left ear into the mediastinum and right axilla and the patient was asked to return to the ED for further work up. He received a CT of chest, abdomen, and pelvis which revealed a mediastinal mass with multiple enlarged nodes in the mediastinum, right axilla, subclavicular and aortocaval nodes near the level of the kidneys. He was then admitted to [**Hospital1 18**], where he underwent VATS and mediastinal mass biopsy, which was nondiagnostic. He was readmitted from [**Date range (1) 9397**], where he had ENT, thoracics and ACS consults who all felt that there were no clear options for where his repeat biopsy should occur. It was felt that his lymph nodes could represent reactive lymphadenopathy from his SVC syndrome, but also that a mediastinal mass biopsy could be unrevealing as this was the case in his last VATS. Therefore he had PET CT to identify FDG-avid lymph nodes most appropriate for biopsy which revealed diffuse disease. He was discharged to home with plan for R axillary LN biopsy today. . Today, he was intubated for airway protection given his habitus prior to procedure. Initial intubation was difficult due to habitus.  On extubation, he wasn't ventilating well with elevated end tidal CO2 despite 30-45 min of Ambu ventilation and was reintubated with difficulty. He had no documented episodes of hypotension throughout. Subsequent to re-intubation, he was found to be in VF and pulseless. Chest compressions were initiated and he was shocked once with ROSC. He subsequently went into PEA arrest and received 2 doses of epinephrine with ROSC. A left femoral a-line and IJ CVL were placed in the setting of the code. .

They checked her fingerstick and it was elevated at 464, and they gave her 6 [**Location **].  Her BP was elevated at 220/110.  They were concerned so they brought her to an outside hospital.

Her UA showed glucose of 1000 but no ketones.  She was given Labetalol 10 mg IV for her elevated blood pressure.  She was taken to Head CT.

He took 10 tabs of pills that he bought on the street (that he thought were methadone) 3 days before admission. The next day he felt lightheaded and nauseous. Then the day of admission he fell out of his bed several times which prompted his mother to call EMS. He denied head strike or loss of conciousness. Denied chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, headache. He initially presented to [**Hospital6 **]. There they discovered the tabs he took were amlodipine 10mg tabs after investigation by a pharmacist. Shortly after arrival, his HR dropped to <20 and he became unresponsive. One round of chest compressions was completed and his HR improved and his pulse returned without further intervention. Medications administered at the OSH included glucagon 8mg, amp bicarb, amp D50, 40 units insulin IV, 30g kayexelate, 3 amps calcium gluconate, 4L NS. He was then med-flighted to [**Hospital1 18**].

He was seen by toxicology who recommended continued high dose insulin, intralipid gtt needed if hemodynamics worsened, and glucose checks every hour. He was started on vanc/Zosyn for possibility of infection.  In the MICU he was bolused with 6L IVF for suspected prerenal [**Last Name (un) **] and was seen by Renal who recommended bicarb gtt for acidosis. Vanc/Zosyn were stopped and levophed was weaned. He was started on thiamine, folate, and a MVI for h/o alcoholism. CXR showed no evidence of PNA, and Abdominal U/S showed cirrhosis with a patent portal vein and normal kidneys. He was started on a CIWA protocol for withdrawal. Of note, his hct and platelets dropped following aggressive fluid resuscitation, but his hct has remained stable at 29. He also complained of new rash and pain in L antecubital region; ultrasound showed no evidence of DVT or fluid collection.

She has been admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for management of sepsis. . #Sepsis: Likely due to line infection, though there is also the possibility of an early LLL pneumonia.  Patient cites a h/o chronic diarrhea, but would also consider possibility of C diff colitis. Will continue empiric coverage with Vanco, Flagyl, and Levaquin and f/u blood cx data.

At present, pt's hypotension is responding to IVF resuscitation, so will wean Levophed with goal to keep SBP>90 (pt's baseline) and UO>30 cc/hr. , #Access: Pt currently has L femoral line due to difficulty obtaining L subclavian vein access.  Will need to contact IR re: venous access issues.  PICC will need to be removed and tip sent for culture. , #Chronic diarrhea: Will send sample for C diff, though suspect her diarrhea is related to her short gut syndrome. Will continue patient's antidiarrheal medications. Patient is on empiric Flagyl. . #Anxiety/depression: Will continue outpt Psych meds. . #Chronic pain: Confirmed pain medication dosages with patient. Will continue her methadone and oxycodone. . #Anemia: Patient has h/o anemia with baselne HCT  26-29 w/ MCV 95. Anemia likely related to her chronic illness, but possible nutritional deficiency.  Will continue Fe supplement. Will check B12/folate levels. . #Metabolic acidosis: VBG notable for CO2=60, possibly related to pt's somnolence.

The patient was diagnosed in [**2095**] with HIV and has been on and off HAART therapy since that time. Most recently, he was on steady treatment for 3 years until this spring when he decided to take a self decided medication holiday. He reports he has not taken HAART medications in about 6 months. About 2-3 months ago the patient also started having watery diarrhea intermittently [**2-18**] times weekly. About one and a half weeks ago, he started noticing high fevers and night sweats. The diarrhea worsened and instead of having it on and off, it became constant. The fevers also continued to worsen and peaked at a temp of 103.6 today, the morning of his admission. Two days prior to admission he started noticing shortness of breath with simple tasks such s climbing a few stairs at home. He also describes a non-productive dry cough and some chest \\\"tightness\\\" associated with this increased work of breathing. He could barely walk from the kitchen back and forth to the couch due to his dyspnea. He has also noticed daily headaches. He denies neck stiffness/rigidity, photophobia or any new skin rashes. He describes some mild blurry vision when he would try to focus on [**Location (un) 1131**] but this would subside after a minute or so. He now complains of diffuse weakness and lightheadedness today. He denies any syncope. Of note, he has lost about 25 pounds over the last couple months which he attributes to a decreased appetite and his diarrhea issues. . In the ED, initial vitals were T 99.4, BP 97/56, P 98, R 22, 85% on RA with only a slight improvement to 91% on 2L. The patient received 1000 mg IV  Vancomycin, 750 mg PO Levofloxacin, and 40 mg oral [**Location (un) 2768**]. He was ordered for Pentamidine 225 mg but did not receive it in the ED. An ABG was done and showed a low pO2 of 72. CXR showed multiple small patchy opacities bilaterally which were immediately concerning for PCP. . On the floor, the patient continued to feel short of breath. He was eventually comfortable on [**4-21**] L NC O2 but noticed he got very winded walking to and from the bathroom. He denied any nausea, vomiting. No abdominal pain. No diarrhea on day of admission. He still felt weak \\\"all over\\\" and had diffuse muscle aches. No headaches on arrival to floor. The patient had an acute exacerbation of his shortness of breath with associated tachypnea and tachycardia soon after admission to the medical floor. This acute episode of respiratory distress was soon after an induced sputum sample and thus, likely due to associated bronchospasms. The patient was hypoxic on labs and was therefore transferred to the MICU for a brief one day stay in order to watch his airway closely while he improved. Fortunately, he improved significantly following nebulizer treatments and high flow supplemental oxygen. He did not require any intubations. He was transferred back to the general medical floor once he was more hemodynamically stable and breathing comfortably on 4L oxygen via nasal cannula with oxygen saturations >95% consistently.\\n\\nMEDICAL HISTORY: HIV/AIDS anemia HSV Depression, ?

Patient was in his usual state of health until [**2142-8-10**] when he noticed that he was not feeling well. Specifically, the patient noticed that he had a decreased appetite, fever, and felt fatigued with a generalized malaise. His symptoms continued through the night, and on the morning of admission ([**8-11**]) he woke with severe frontal headache with chills and fever of 101.6F (measured at home); he was not experiencing nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, or chest pain. Throughout the day, his symptoms progressed and he eventually realized that he was having difficulty using swipe text (w/ his Left hand) on his smart phone. Specifically, he was leaving his finger on letters for a prolonged period of time without fluid swiping and he was also missing and incorrectly dialing many letters. His visual field, vision and comprehension were all intact; however he felt that his L hand was slow and responsible for the newfound deficit. Furthermore, patient reports that he and his wife noticed that while he was drinking from a soda can, he would set the can on its side rather than upright. Lastly, the patient noticed that he was having difficulty putting his pants on because his left leg felt clumsy and weak.

Patient initially presented to the ED with an unclear complaint but was tearful. She stated that she had had a seizure while in the taxi cab on the way over to the ED but it was unclear why she was coming to the hospital in the first place; pt would not provide a complete history. It was eventually determined that she had taken 60 pills of Ultram earlier in the evening shortly after finding out that her boyfriend had cheated on her; pt endorsed this was an intentional suicide attempt. No other details of the history were available at that time as the patient was intubated in ED and no collateral sources were available. . On arrival at the [**Hospital1 18**] ED she was alert and oriented but noted to be agitated and labile. She was tachycardic to 160s and hypertensive to 158/105. On exam she was noted to have small but reactive pupils (3 -> 2 mm) and persistent clonus in her right lower extremity, as well as 8-10 beats of clonus in her left lower extremity. She also exhibited hyperreflexia bilaterally in her lower extremities. She was able to respond to questions. An EKG showed sinus tach with normal QTc ~430.  Ativan was about to be initiated when the pt had another 30 second tonic clonic seizure in ED witnessed by ED physicians.Pt had no apnea but remained post-ictal for 10-15 minutes and was slow to arouse. . Toxicology was consulted who felt that her findings overall were potentially concerning for serotonin syndrome, although it was more likely that her symptoms were limited to medication-induced seizures. Treatment with supportive measures initiated, however given her repeated seizures it was felt that an elective intubation was warranted. This was discussed with the patient who agreed, and she was intubated with etomodate and succinate and started on a propafol gtt for sedation.  Her vital signs at the time of transfer to the unit were 105 118/69 100%/FiO2. She remained afebrile. . In the MICU, pt was stablized and was able to be quickly extubated w/out difficulty ([**2116-11-27**]). Pt did not have additional seizures. However, code purple was called for agitation/hostility towards staff/wanting to leave hospital; pt pulled out all iv lines, refusing labs. Psych was consulted and pt was sectioned (Section 12; can't leave AMA). Per toxicology, needed to monitor for seizures for at least 24 hours; use benzos not haldol for agitation, and held of restarting cymbalta. On [**2116-11-28**], Lorazepam 2 mg PO/NG Q4H:PRN agitation ordered, b/c pt almost code purpled again for smoking and lighting match after a bowel movement. On [**2116-11-29**] pt called out to the floor . Tox said to monitor lower extremity clonus. Eventually pt will be transferred to inpt psych when bed available; currently sectioned 12 so not ok to leave AMA. psych will continue to follow her while inpatient. . Per most recent Psych note; \\\"Pt. is frustrated by continued stay in the hospital.

The patient complained of mild shortness of breath and hoarseness at that time.  A chest x-ray at the outside hospital showed left lower lobe infiltrate, then Levaquin was started.  A CT angiogram was done for increasing shortness of breath and showed no evidence of pulmonary embolism; however, CT scan of the chest did show a right hilar mass 1.3 cm nodule in the superior segment of the right lower lobe.  On two occasions, was found to have an increasing troponin of 4.0 with a CK of around 100.  Cardiac echocardiogram showed a very impaired left ventricular ejection fraction.  She was then transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for cardiac catheterization.  The cardiac catheterization showed patent coronary arteries with an increased left ventricular end diastolic pressure of 28.  After the procedure, the patient became tachypneic and hypoxemic due to acute heart failure with fluid overload and thus she was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for further management.  She was diuresed over two liters and oxygen demands decreased significantly.  Cardiology considered the poor left ventricular function to be caused by viral myocarditis.  They suggested no steroid or biopsy of the myocardium because of no benefits or no change in further management.  They recommended low dose beta blockers, continuing ACE inhibitor and digoxin.  After her condition was stable she was transferred to the Medical Floor for further treatment.\\n\\nMEDICAL HISTORY: 1.

He was extremely active, walking on a daily basis up until the end of last summer. At that point he began experiencing chest discomfort. The patient??????s daughter [**Name (NI) **] is unaware if her father reported his symptoms to his PCP but she knows he stopped walking at that point.  She states that approximately two months ago he began to experience a choking sensation with exertion and developed a hoarse throat.  He saw his PCP and was referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7047**] for cardiac consultation. He underwent a nuclear stress test on [**2183-4-25**] where he was able to exercise 4.5 minutes of [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] protocol to a peak heart rate of 137 bpm, representing 101% of his age predicted maximum, and stopping due to fatigue.  He did not experience any chest discomfort and his EKG was uninterpretable due to baseline abnormalities though there were 1-2 mm of inferolateral ST depression.   Nuclear imaging demonstrated a small area of inferior wall ischemia.  His EF was 63% at rest and decreased to 54% with stress. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7047**] reportedly started him on a beta blocker, statin, PPI and Imdur. His daughter reports he had no improvement in his symptoms.  Apparently he was working in his yard on [**5-6**], when he once again, developed the sensation of \\\"choking\\\" in his chest and throat.  This was followed by 3-4 days of feeling ill and remaining in bed.  His daughter reports she have never seen her father so lethargic or ill and apparently her father described his chest and throat discomfort as his worse episode yet.

He had right leg weakness developing back in [**2120**].  By the time he was operated on he had recurrent focal seizures and was having severe right virtually no fine motor control at the ankle or foot.  His right upper extremity was affected as well, but to a much lesser extent.  He had moderate fine movement in the right hand.  He underwent surgical excision and there was malignant alteration with increased cellularity and single cell necrosis and extensive multifocal tissue necrosis with large diffusely infiltrating histologic benign component typical of required reoperation.  At that time he had radiation therapy carried out near his home at [**Hospital3 44339**] Hospital in [**Location (un) 45098**], [**State 2748**].  He did well again until [**2139**] when he was found to have a small recurrence in the posterior margin of the removal cavity.  He underwent focal radiation at [**Hospital3 28333**] [**Hospital3 **].  The area of gadolinium enhancement on MR scan cleared and he did well until the summer of [**2141**] when he started having focal partial seizures involving the right hand.  Repeat MRI scan showed recurrence of a gadolinium enhanced tumor again in the posterior margin of the removal cavity in the parietal region posteriorly.  Repeat SPECT scan with thallium was consistent with tumor recurrence.  This was compared with a prior thallium scan in [**2139**] prior to his high energy beam radiation to that site.  The overall recommendation of radiation therapy was to reoperate and remove this area rather than consider any further high energy beam radiation at this time.  It was thought that the risks outweighed the benefits and that since the area was one which could be approached surgically without high risk to function, removal of as much active tumor as possible was the best course of treatment.\\n\\nMEDICAL HISTORY: He has known esophageal reflux.

The patient was in his normal state of health which was poor at baseline until the day of admission.  At hemodialysis the patient was found to have a increased white blood cell count of 17 and temperature of approximately 101.  He was transferred from his outpatient dialysis unit to transplant surgery team at [**Hospital6 256**] for evaluation of his arteriovenous graft.  During the month prior to admission the patient had positive cultures from his catheter at his hemodialysis for Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.  Initially the patient had a subclavian tunnel catheter that was found positive for Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in [**2194-9-20**].  That line was discontinued and a left upper extremity arteriovenous graft was placed [**2194-10-10**].  The arteriovenous graft was used prior to maturation.  On [**10-26**], the patient's left upper extremity arteriovenous graft was noted to have some purulent discharge, the patient had shakes and chills, however, was afebrile and had a normal white blood cell count.  At that time the graft was cultured and Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus grew out on culture.  The patient was started on Vancomycin and Gentamicin a few days later.  He completed a 34 day course of Vancomycin and a 31 day course of Gentamicin prior to his admission at [**Hospital6 256**].  In addition, over the weeks prior to admission the patient had multiple blood cultures drawn for unclear reasons at hemodialysis that were positive for Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus that were sensitive to Ampicillin and Penicillin.  The patient was not treated for this Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus.  The blood cultures will mostly be drawn from the left upper extremity arteriovenous graft.  On admission the patient also complained of increasing low back pain over the last three days.  The patient has chronic low back pain at baseline.  He has a history of a lumbar abscess/osteomyelitis that required surgical drainage and [**Location (un) 931**] rod placement in the thoracic through the lumbar spine to help with spinal stability in [**2184**].  The patient received a left upper extremity ultrasound which revealed a patent graft with some inflammatory changes but no fluid collection, however, there was a small thrombus outside of the graft itself.  Blood cultures were drawn and a transesophageal echocardiogram was performed.  The transesophageal echocardiogram showed a 2 by 1.2 cm pedunculated vegetation on the atrial side of the posterior leaflet of the mitral valve with moderate points for regurgitation and a mild stream of mitral regurgitation at the leaflet base indicating a small perforation.  At that time, the patient was transferred to the General Medicine Team.  Of note, the patient was seen at the dentist the day prior to presentation.  The only procedure was done was that his dentures were put into place.  There was no surgery performed.  On admission the patient had severe asterixes and myoclonus. After approximately one and a half weeks of hospitalization with multiple dialysis treatments the symptoms seemed to resolve.  Unclear of etiology, however, probably related to uremia.\\n\\nMEDICAL HISTORY: 1.  The patient was in a good state of health until approximately ten years ago.

Spinal instability requiring two [**Location (un) 931**] rod placements in [**2184**] after spinal abscess removed.  5.  Kidney failure, the patient was told that his end stage renal disease was secondary to nephrolithiasis.  At the time of this dictation, unable to obtain medical records to clarify the etiology.  Five years ago the patient was extremely fatigued and was diagnosed with calcinosis in his skin.  At that time he started on dialysis for a few months.  He was doing well off of dialysis until last year at which time he was restarted on hemodialysis on [**2194-3-20**].  6.  End stage renal disease on hemodialysis, the patient commonly has low blood pressure, shakiness and chills after hemodialysis.  7.  History over the past year of multiple clots in his dialysis line according to his mother. 8.  Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, unclear of length and duration of time but the patient is on Coumadin on admission. The patient thought that his Coumadin was to prevent catheter clot.  9.

The abdominal pain is predominantly over his RUQ, at the site of his cholecystostomy tube. He also has lingering mild left sided pain that has been present since his surgery. Finally, he has had thigh pain and weakness while at the rehab facility. There, he had blood cultures drawn, and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] out of concern for bacteremia. Today's labs from rehab facility revealed WBC to 11.3 with 87.9 PMNs. His INR has been < 2 since [**10-16**]. Microbiology data from rehab (see below) featured wound culture with VRE and klebsiella, and UCx with yeast, presumptive c. albicans.  During prior admission, patient was found to have cholecystitis on HIDA scan, polymicrobial bacteremia with e. coli and abiothropha, as well as enterococcus in abdominal wall wound culture. IR placed percutaneous cholecystostomy drain on [**9-18**], with plan to have patient undergo elective lap chole after renal failure had improved. The patient had an ED visit on [**10-13**] for left-sided colicky abdominal pain, for which CT ruled out nephrolithiasis or urolithiasis. He was started on amox-clav for u/a with 6-10 WBC and few bacteria, with no culture.  In the ED today, vital signs were 101.1, 88, 150/54, 18, 95% 2L. The patient was AAO x3, with TTP in RUQ and RLQ, with cholecystostomy tube in place. Labs notable for WBC 12K, with normal LFTs and troponin. CXR, CT chest/abd/pelvis, and abd u/s were unrevealing for source of infection. The patient was seen by the surgical service, who felt no urgent surgical interventions were necessary at this time, but recommended that ortho spine be consulted for question of possible fluid collection in post-surgical site. The patient was given five liters NS with improvement of his systolic BP to the 110s. He had also had atrial fibrillation with RVR to 150s early in ED course, which resolved with the IV fluids. He was given two doses of pip/tazo 4.5g, and linezolid 600 mg IV, as well as one gram of acetaminophen. 2 18 gauge PIVs and a foley were placed.

After his last hospitalization (d/c on [**2125-1-8**]), he was able to ambulate with a walker and had achieved modest pain control with methadone (dose was increased to 60 mg PO TID) to the point where he was not using much dilaudid for breakthrough. However, since then, he has called the clinic multiple times for worsening pain not covered by medications at home. He's increased the use of dilaudid to approximately 24 mg PO daily and had also started using MS Contin 30 mg PO BID. Despite these medications, he has been essentially bed bound, to the point where he is not even able to stand and self cath. Since starting MS Contin, he has had nausea and emesis (brown, nonbloody, nonbilious). He has not eaten any PO solids in 2 days. He came to clinic today for a regularly scheduled appointment, during which he was supposed to get gemzaar and zometa. However, treatment was deferred and the pt was admitted to 7F for better pain control and possible [**Hospital1 1501**] placement.

ONC HX: In [**2124-5-22**], he was diagnosed with metastatic renal cell carcinoma following a pathological fracture of his left femur. His leg was stabilized at [**Hospital1 336**], and a biopsy of the left thigh mass was positive for clear cell carcinoma. His postoperative course was complicated by a PE and treated with Lovenox. A bone scan also revealed metastasis to the left distal femur and right acetabulum. From [**2124-5-29**] to [**2124-6-16**] he received palliative radiation to these areas. Subsequently, in a staging work-up, a torso CT also indicated two lung lesions, and a lesion in his right kidney. The patient transferred his oncological care to [**Hospital1 69**] in [**2124-8-22**] and started on Zometa and Sutent. Later that month, an MRI of the brain indicated a solitary enhancing mass in the right occipital lobe. The lesion was treated with Cyberknife radiosurgery on [**2124-9-18**] to 2,220 cGy in one fraction. On [**2124-10-9**] the patient presented to the ED with urinary retention, numbness of his perineal area, and leg pain. An MRI of the thoracic/lumbar spine indicated lesions in the sacrum and T5 vertebrae. Subsequently, he had external beam radiation to these areas from [**2124-10-10**] to [**2124-10-16**]. He has been intermittently on Sutent since [**8-27**]. During his last admission in [**11-27**], the Sutent was stopped as it was thought it was contributing to his neutropenia and esophagitis.

The patient was given two aspirin and Nitroglycerin was held secondary to decreased blood pressure.  The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for catheterization.  Catheterization demonstrated a right dominant system.  The LMCA was normal; left anterior descending with 90% occlusion after the first diagonal, left circumflex occluded after small high obtuse marginal.  Right coronary artery was normal.   The patient's left circumflex occlusion was across revealing a long severe lesion with marked tortuosity.  It was dilated and stented with two overlapping Hepacoat stents with no residual and normal flow.  The thrombotic occlusion resolved with wire manipulation with a final very distal occlusion.  The patient's 90% ostial lesion of the small obtuse marginal 1 with normal flow was not treated at that time.  Hemodynamic RA pressure mean of 9.0, PA pressure of 35/14 with a mean of 24, RV 35/6 and pressure of 11.  TCW mean of 13. ......was 6.07 cardiac index 3.09.  The patient received heparin and Integrilin during the catheterization and had one episode of bradycardia with heart rate to the 30s.

The history was obtained from the medical record and is not clear. Pt may have had a fall from standing vs. possible seizure activity vs. possible assault. It is not clear whether this was a witnessed event or if pt was presumed to have fallen foward, because of injuries to his face. Pt was taken to an OSH yesterday morning where he was initially alert and talking. Head and neck CTs and CXR were negative per report from OSH records. Pt was seen by ENT who repaired a lip lac but did not document any facial fractures. Throughout the course of the day, pt became increasingly agitated. EtOH level was <10, and given his ETOH history, pt was believed to be in withdrawal. He received increasing doses of ativan and was put on an ativan gtt (prior to intubation). Given the increasing agitation as well as increased facial swelling, pt was ultimately intubated for airway protection. Pt was first started on propofol but became hypotensive with a HR in the 140s to 180s and was then switched to fentanyl and versed with some improvement in hemodynamics. Pt was also given Thiamine, Folate, MVI & approx 2L of NS, then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]. . In the ED here, VS: T 97, HR 130, BP 144/74, RR 20, 98%. He was noted to have minimally reactive pupils and was moving when off sedation (pt had been given fentanyl, ativan, and versed for sedation). Pt had a repeat head CT which showed a small intracranial hemorrhage, pt was then noted to be in Afib with RVR of 160s. Pt received a total of 5L NS. FAST exam was negative. Pt received a total of 15mg diltiazem IV with SBP to 90s and HR 110, he was  then started on a dilt gtt with HR 120s and SBP 100s.

Pt was admitted with a nonhealing foot ulcer on her right foot and a gangrenous toe. Pt underwent angiography of the right on [**6-22**]. This showed a patent CFA and profunda. The SFA and popliteal were diffusely diseased. AT with multiple regions of stenosis along its length. There was also an occluded distal AT and reconstitution of the distal DP an dlateral tarsal. The PT and peroneal were occluded. The pt underwent PTA of the entire AT with a 3x10 balloon. Pt had recanalization of distal AT and DP artery with a PTA with a 2x2 balloon. The procedure went well and the pt was started on ASA and plavix postop. In the early morning of [**6-23**], the pt's postop course was complicated by rapid atrial fib. Cardiology was consulted and per their recs, her beta blocker was increased to 25 mg [**Hospital1 **], electrolytes were followed closely, and an echo was checked.

Before admission, pt was being treated for C. diff, with positive assay noted at NH 2 weeks PTA (had a course of PO flagyl but still had diarrhea so was changed to PO vanc). At OSH CT ABD showed pan colitis. Pt was stabilized with IVF digoxin for a fib and transfered to [**Hospital1 18**]. At BICMC surgery evaluated and felt the collitis to be most likely infectious. Pt was hypotensive in the ED so went to the MICU. In the MICU PO vanc was continued and PO flagyl was added for C. Diff. BP stabilized to basline of SBP 90-100 with fluid resuscitation - no pressors were required. All cultures negative since admission. C. Diff assay has been negative here, but he has continued to have diarrhea. He was transferred to the floor with stable VS. . On the floor, he has had a worsening polyarticular gout flare. He was restarted on his home colchicine and probenacid with little relief of symptoms. Rheumatology was consulted and recommended a steroid taper, but the floor team decided to hold off on this in the setting of infection. UA was positive after transfer and cipro was started empirically. . On the afternoon after transfer, he triggered for low urine output. This was felt to be due to hypovolemia and he was given 1L of 1/2NS because of concern for hypernatremia. By 10pm he had made ~500cc urine since midnight. He was then hypotensive to mid-80s systolic. At that time he was afebrile and it was felt that hypotension was still most likely due to hypovolemia. He received 500cc NS with good effect (SBP to 100s). Following this he became febrile to 100.8, BP returned to mid-80s systolic. Continue to have very poor urine output. Blood pressure and urine output did not respond to a further 1L of NS. Mental status grossly the same although patient has baseline dementia. Was unable to swallow pills however which is reportedly new. On repeat exam patient was felt to have mild guarding although he denied pain, he did not have rebound tenderness. CXR did not show free air. Given possibility of urosepsis with resistant organism, Cipro was broadened to Zosyn.  With volume resuscitation, patient began to get more edematous in lower extremities and scrotum. He continued to breathe comfortably on room air however O2 saturation went from 99-100% to 94-95%.  On arrival, he was unable to give additional details of history. He denies CP, SOB, orthopnea, PND, cough, abdominal pain, N/V.

The patient had been in her usual state of health until three days prior to admission when she began experiencing shortness of breath and mild chest pain.  She had had decreased p.o. intake for the day prior to admission and was seen in oncology clinic the day of admission and referred to the emergency department. In the emergency department the patient was saturating approximately 70 percent on room air with cyanosis. After being placed on a nonrebreather the patient's saturation improved to the 80s.  Chest x-ray revealed a right pleural effusion and an increased heart size.  The patient was escalated to BiPAP and then mask ventilation and eventually was intubated.  Her electrocardiogram showed diffuse ST changes and a stat echocardiogram was performed which showed a large pericardial effusion without signs of tamponade.  However. the patient was taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory where she had a brief cardiac arrest.  Her rhythm remained sinus tachycardia but she had no blood pressure.  The pericardial drain was placed for pericardial tamponade and 260 cc of pericardial fluid was removed.  The patient was resuscitated with this drainage and with 3 amps of epinephrine.  Patient was subsequently put on dopamine.  Her electrolytes were checked and her potassium was found to be 6.1.  She was given insulin, D50 and Kayexalate at that time and brought to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.

His illness began with bilateral ear aches [**2-19**] weeks ago. This was also accompanied by fevers measured to be 103 degrees. His ear pain resolved somewhat, but he has had ongoing dyspnea and productive cough with large amounts of yellow sputum since then. He had one episode of blood-tinged sputum, in the setting of blowing his nose and coughing frequently. He presented to an outpatient provider approximately two weeks prior to admission who prescribed him a six-day course of azithromycin. He had a mild improvement in his symptoms and also took amoxicillin.  One day prior to admission, his symptoms progressed. He presented to the [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] Emergency Dept with worsening dyspnea. In the ED, his initial vital signs were 98.0, 96, 111/72, 88% RA.

He was in his otherwise good state of health until 2AM today when he developed acute onset of chest pain that woke him up from sleep.  It is described as substernal/left sternal pressure radiating to the jaw.  Was associated with mild SOB but no nausea or diaphoresis.  He was concerned that he might be having a heart attack so he took an ASA and called EMS.  Received another ASA by EMS and arrived to the ED at 4:40AM. .

The patient was delirious at time of discharge and unable to effectively communicate that he was having pain in his left hip. According to the patient's son, his mental status quickly cleared at the LTAC and he was able to report severe pain in his left hip. This provoked the LTAC to obtain X-rays of the hip which showed dislocation necessitating transfer back to [**Hospital1 18**] for ortho evaluation. He remains on vanco for MRSA bacteremia to complete a 6 week course per ID recommendations and still has his midline in place. . In the emergency department initial vital signs were 99.2, 83, 108/56, 16, 99% 2L NC. He was later noted to have a fever of 102, but his son says that he did not feel as though the patient had a fever because he did not feel warm and his temperature resolved quickly to 99, although he was given 1gm of Tylenol. He received 500cc of IVFs for SBP in the 90s and his SBP climbed to 110s. He also received Zosyn 4.5gms as a CXR in the ED could not r/o PNA and his vanco level was checked at 16.7. An EKG showed atrial fibrillation and no changes from his prior. Orthopedics was consulted and his hip was reduced under conscious sedation with propofol. Repeat films after the hip manipulation showed successful relocation of the hip. He was admitted for documented fever on vanco in the setting of low SBP to the 90s. . On arrival in the ICU the patient was alert, pleasant, and conversational. The son notes that the patient's mental status improved dramatically after his hip was put back into place by ortho and postulates that his delirium was likely related to pain. Otherwise, the patient has no complaints and did not feel febrile in the ED.

He began experiencing this pain in [**2150**] after he underwent right and left sided CEA. The pain occurred in the morning, though it would not wake him up from sleep and would not be elicited by chewing. Over the past year, the pain has increased in frequency to approximately once per day occurring in primarily the morning. The pain is in the high right upper jaw near the TM joint in a V3 distribution. The pain is 'shooting' and he rates it as [**2161-8-28**]. . Mr. [**Known lastname 87151**] and his PCP report that his pain has become much worse over the last month in terms of the frequency in that they began occurring every few minutes. I spoke with the patient's PCP who says that he began ramping up the patient's tegretol up to the most recent dose of 400 mg of tegretol SR. The patient's pain improved with more tegretol, but he began experiencing gait instability attributed to the tegretol as well as several falls. The PCP discontinued the patient's coumadin (for afib) as a result of these falls. Despite initial improvement with tegretol, the patient's right facial pain again worsened. This led to his recent hospitalization at [**Hospital3 **]. He was discharged on Monday ([**2157-9-19**]) from NWH on 400 mg tegretol SR [**Hospital1 **] as well as a neurontin 200 mg PO TID. . The patient reports that since returning home on Monday the pain has been occurring every few minutes. The patient has not been taking in good PO's as a result and has been extremely uncomfortable. In addition to the neurontin, he has been taking percocet Q2-4 hours to manage his pain. . #Problem #2, Hypotension: Mr. [**Known lastname 87151**] was at home yesterday when his VNA nurse came in and woke him up. The patient had taken percocet that morning. He felt dizzy and 'dopey'. The nurse felt that the patient was not himself and was concerned enough to call EMS. At that time, the patient had no chest pain, SOB, visual changes, palpitations, or headache. EMS found him to hypotensive with SBP of 70. . #ED Course: In ED, Mr. [**Known lastname 87151**] was hypotensive with vital signs of 96.2 HR 55 BP 77/33 and lethargic. After 2L IVF bolus his BP improved to SBP 92, and another 2L NS of fluid were given and bp stabilized at 128. A bedside ultrasound performed did not show evidence of effusion or tamponade. In addition, an EKG was performed initially thought to be 2 AVB, but in review with cardiology, it was interpreted at afib and the recommendation was made to rule out Mr. [**Known lastname 87151**] for MI. He otherwise had a negative head CT for ICH, and became more orientated during his ED course, but he continued to complain of his right sided facial pain. His cardiac enzymes were negative times 2. .

Of note, on presentation, her face was swollen, she was tachypneic and tachycardic.  Her labs were notable for a WBC of 4.4, hemoglobin 8.4, and hematocrit of 25.  She was given IV morphine for her abdominal pain, when she subseuqently broke out in a rash, which diminshed with benadryl.

The patient now states that his pain is worse on his right leg compared to his left.  He also complains of intermittent numbness, greater in his right leg as compared to his left.  The ED has consulted Vascular Surgery because his distal RLE was cool to the touch.  The patient continues to complain of severe RLE calf pain.  He is unable to walk on it now.  He denies any history of claudication.  He has no history of a-fib.  The pain is not any better when he hangs his leg over the side of the bed.  He complains that his right foot feels 'numb' subjectively.  He denies any pain in his feet bilaterally.\\n\\nMEDICAL HISTORY: PMH:  obesity, CAD, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, gout, abnormal LFTs, diabetes, anxiety, BPH, colon polyps, lung nodule, diabetic nephropathy, and obstructive sleep apnea\\n\\nMEDICATION ON ADMISSION: AMLODIPINE - 5 mg Tablet - 1 Tablet(s) by mouth once a day COLCHICINE - 0.6 mg Tablet - 1 Tablet(s) by mouth twice a day EZETIMIBE-SIMVASTATIN [VYTORIN [**9-/2150**]] - 10-80 mg Tablet - 1 Tablet(s) by mouth once a day GLIPIZIDE [GLUCOTROL] -  (Dose adjustment - no new Rx) - 10 mg Tablet - 1 Tablet(s) by mouth twice a day HYDROCODONE-ACETAMINOPHEN - 5 mg-500 mg Tablet - [**12-24**] Tablet(s) by mouth at bedtime as needed for pain ISOSORBIDE MONONITRATE - 30 mg Tablet Sustained Release 24 hr - 1 Tablet(s) by mouth once a day LISINOPRIL - 40 mg Tablet - 1 Tablet(s)(s) by mouth once a day METHYLPREDNISOLONE - 4 mg Tablets, Dose Pack - taper Tablets(s) by mouth as directed METOPROLOL SUCCINATE [TOPROL XL] - 100 mg Tablet Sustained Release 24 hr - one tablet once a day PIOGLITAZONE [ACTOS] - 30 mg Tablet - 1 Tablet(s) by mouth once a day for diabetes ASPIRIN - 325 MG Tablet, Delayed Release (E.C.) - ONE BY MOUTH EVERY DAY\\n\\nALLERGIES: Allopurinol\\n\\nPHYSICAL EXAM: VS: T 98.2 P 74  BP 120/101  20  98 RA GENERAL:  AAOx3, lying in bed, NAD Chest: CTAB CV: RRR Abd: obese, soft, NT/ND, well healed surgical scars RLE: 2+ Femoral, Biphasic Popliteal, unable to doppler DP, Biphasic PT.

The patient was discharged to this rehabilitation from [**Hospital1 69**] in [**2177-7-10**].  Prior to the admission to [**Hospital1 346**] Medical Intensive Care Unit from [**7-3**] until [**2177-8-1**], she was also here in early [**Month (only) **] as well.  In the first admission, she was admitted for a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare and was noted to have bilateral pleural effusions and pericardial effusions with tamponade physiology.  This was tapped under ultrasound guidance and found to be exudative with negative cytology and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Doctor First Name **] of 1.160.  She was then readmitted nine days later with shortness of breath again, thought to be a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare and was treated with nebulizers, Lasix and Solu-Medrol.  She was found to have tamponade physiology on a transthoracic echocardiogram, underwent balloon pericardiotomy and intubated for airway protection.  An ultrasound guided thoracentesis on [**7-4**] for a left pleural effusion which was found to be transudative was performed and the patient was extubated successfully.  Five days later, both the pleural effusion and the pericardial effusions reaccumulated requiring re-intubation on [**7-9**].  The patient went to the Operating Room for a pericardial window, a left chest tube and a left pleurodesis.  After this, she was unable to extubate and was then returned to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.  Failure to wean in the Medical Intensive Care Unit was secondary to diaphragmatic weakness and she was noted to have critical care polyneuropathy/myopathy per EMG on [**2177-7-24**].  She underwent tracheotomy on [**2177-7-17**].  The cause of the pleural and pericardial effusions are unknown. The work-up was basically negative; there were no malignant cells found in either of the fluids and the pericardial window biopsy was negative.  Also, Rheumatology evaluated her and thought it was not secondary to a rheumatological cause because her admission [**Doctor First Name **] on [**7-6**] was negative (however, she had positive [**Doctor First Name **] on [**2177-7-25**] times two).  Her Pulmonary status improved and the effusions remained stable so she was discharged to Vent-Core on [**2177-8-1**].  She did well at the rehabilitation and her course there was actually unknown to us at this point, however, we do know that she was unable to be weaned off of her ventilator.  She was currently on CMV with a total volume of 500, respiratory rate of 12 and an FIO2 of 40% and had recently failed a PS trial secondary to tachypnea and low volume.\\n\\nMEDICAL HISTORY: 1.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease:  Restrictive lung disease with reactive airway disease. 2.  Status post tracheostomy on [**7-17**] and PEG placement on [**2177-7-28**].  Her tube feeds are at a goal of 35 cc per hour.  She has been unable to be weaned off her ventilator at Vent-Core. 3.  Pericardial effusion / tamponade that was found to be exudative with negative cytologies.  Status post window placement on [**2177-7-9**]. 4.  Bilateral pleural effusions, transudative, status post left pleurodesis on [**2177-7-9**]. 5.  Breast cancer (DCIF), status post total mastectomy, ER-pos, Stage 2, no radiation, N0 M0, and currently off tamoxifen. 6.  Severe hypertension, on five medications. 7.  Type 2 diabetes mellitus, previously on oral hypoglycemics and now requiring insulin. 8.  Chronic renal insufficiency secondary to diabetes mellitus with nephrotic range proteinuria. 9.  Acute renal failure secondary to intravenous dye in [**2177-7-10**].  Also had a history of elevated creatinine secondary to ACE inhibitors. 10. Thalassemia trait. 11. Questionable history of osteogenesis imperfecta. 12. Legal blindness; she has a left eye prosthesis as well. 13. Urinary incontinence. 14. Echocardiogram results from [**2177-6-9**] revealed a right ventricular wall clot/tumor with an ejection fraction of 58%. Her latest echocardiogram at [**Hospital1 188**] on [**2177-7-22**], revealed an ejection fraction of greater than 65%, mild LAE, mild symmetrical left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regular wall motion; mild thickened atrial valve and mitral valve leaflets; moderate pulmonary hypertension; small to moderate pericardial effusion predominantly over the right ventricle. No change when compared to the prior study of [**2177-7-17**]. 15.  Noted to have Vancomycin resistant enterococcus in her urine on [**7-23**]. 16.  Left ocular paresthesia. 17.  Anemia; it appears that her baseline hematocrit is usually in the high 20s. 18.  SPAP with 2% gamma band, likely consistent with MGUS.

She normally walks this route without difficulty.  The shortness of breath was not associated with chest pain, nausea, vomiting or diaphoresis and resolved quickly.  On the Saturday prior to admission, she experienced similar isolated shortness of breath while on a shopping trip.  The same evening she noted the onset of vague nonradiating epigastric discomfort that made it difficult for her to sleep.  This was associated with intermittent nausea but no vomiting.  She denied frank chest pain or shortness of breath at this point. She denies history of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea or orthopnea.  She has no cardiac risk factors.  The discomfort was constant and progressive throughout the day on Sunday. On Sunday evening, she was again unable to sleep due to epigastric discomfort and nausea prompting her family to take her to [**Hospital3 68**].

At that time, he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2160-9-9**] for a rigid and flexible bronchscopy where they found that the right mainstem was approximately 80-90% obstructed by a tumor mass coming from the right upper lobe.

They performed multiple biopsies of the friable mass. Following the biopsies, the tumor was destroyed with electrocautery and argon plasma coagulation. However, they were not able to achieve patency of the right upper lobe bronchus. The right mainstem was completely patent at the end of the procedure.

Patient does not recall the exact events leading up to her admission, she remembers losing urine continence and does not believe she had LOC. Says she was sleeping all day and then developed abdominal pain, but is not able to relay any other events from earlier today. She reports 3 week history of abdominal pain with 1 episode of diarrhea this AM, nausea and vomiting for 3 days, poor PO intake and a reported loss of 50lbs in 3 months. She reports a [**11-4**] headache since this AM with blurry vision for 2 days. Also has had non-productive cough for indeterminate amount of days, no sore throat. No chest pain or SOB. She has no BRBPR or melena, no hematemesis, no fevers/chills. No history of seizures, no recent EtOH or drug use per patient. .

On arrival to the ED, her T 97.2, BP was 220/135 and HR 130s, 99% RA, and she was triggered. Given total of 40mg IV hydralazine with improvement in BP to 180/105. She was complaining of severe abdominal pain and was tender diffusely on exam. She had 1 episode of coffee ground emesis, but refused NG lavage. Stool was guaiac negative. Per report, patient had possible recent crack use though pt denied any illicit drug use, only EtOH. . ECG in the ED showed ST with HR 125, LAD with STD in V4-6. CT head was limited by artifact but showed \\\"tiny\\\" SAH at the left parietal vertex with no other abnormalities. CT abdomen showed diffuse small bowel wall thickening, also involving sigmoid and rectum with moderate volume ascites. Surgery was consulted and felt that radiographic findings could be vasculitic in nature and related to pt's SLE, less likely ischemic given normal lactate and WBC.

Two days after her endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, she woke up in the middle of the night with an acute headache involving the back of her head.  This was very maximal onset and felt like a punch in the back of the head.  The head pain was dull and not throbbing.  This did not let up at all and two days later she had some nausea and neck stiffness.  She did not have any fever, chills, eye pain or bloody vision or other visual symptoms.  She states that the headache is worse when she cough or strains.  She has had vertigo in the past but this is not the case now.  She went to the [**Hospital3 2358**] Emergency Room yesterday for evaluation and received Demerol 25 mg times six as well as Versed, Phenergan, Dilaudid.  She had a normal CT scan and a lumbar puncture which showed 0 white cells (tube number four had 10 white cells), 400 red cells  (tube four had 240 red cells), glucose 49 and protein 55.  No opening pressure was recorded.  Afterward she felt worse with the headache and it extended to the bifrontal region.  She also received one dose of ceftriaxone for meningitis coverage.  She currently has a 7 out of 10 headache pain.  She does report having occasional headaches around her period located in the occiput.

Patient initially went to [**Hospital6 43614**] Center in [**2152-11-10**] for CP. W/u revealed a new mediastinal mass and he was transferred to Togus VA for further workup. An initial bronchoscopy was performed but biopsies have been nondiagnostic. A f/u CT on [**2153-6-3**] revealed spread of the mass to the right lung. He also developed pneumonia during this time and went into new-onset atrial flutter during another bronchoscopy which had to be aborted because of this event. He was started on diltiazem and coumadin. However, his rate was difficult to control. He underwent repeat bronchoscopy in [**Month (only) 205**] but obtained tissue only revealed necrosis per the patient. . The patient was eventually transferred to the VA [**Location (un) 669**] for CT-guided biopsy given these unsuccessful attempts to make a diagnosis. He was initially on the floor after admission on [**2153-7-3**] but transferred to the CCU b/o 6-8 seconds pauses after diltiazem, digoxin and atenolol given for treatment resistent atrial flutter with RVR in the 150s. His coumadin was held for the biopsy and he was kept on a heparin drip. His rate remained difficult to be controlled despite several treatment attempts. He became symptomatic after relative bradycardia to the 60s (nausea, dizziness, lightheadedness and diarrhea). His symptoms abated after CBB reversal and dopamine drip. . His course was c/b wheezing and SOB as well as increasing SVC syndrome with swelling of his face, both arms and ears. He initially received a 5-day course of PO prednisone for wheezing but was switched to IV decadrone to reduce swelling from his SVC compression. He was also started on azithromycin for post-obstructive PNA. . The CT-guided biopsy showed sarcoma versus melanoma. Plans were made to provide XRT at [**Location (un) 538**] VA. However, he was transferred eventually to [**Hospital1 18**] because of the concern for airway compromise during XRT. He was transferred on Verapamil and Digoxin for rate control as well as a heparin drip. . On ROS, the patient denies any fevers but nightsweats since [**2115**], weightloss (10 lbs in one month) with decreased appetite, and cough with clear sputum and occasional brownish clots coming up. He denies frank hemoptysis, N/V or SOB in rest. However, he did become more SOB over the last few months, most recently he can only walk to the bathroom w/o dyspnea. He is on 2L home O2.

The patient was sent to the Emergency Department after an electrocardiogram was found to have new ST depressions in V5 and V6 and T-wave inversion in 1, AVL, V2-V6.  In the Emergency Department, the patient was given aspirin, heparin, Integrilin, and was noted to be pain free.  He was subsequently admitted to the C-MED service overnight where he was asymptomatic.  At this time, the patient had no electrocardiogram changes.  CK's were 170 and 140, MB fraction normal, troponin less than 0.01 times 2.  The patient went to catheterization on [**2149-12-26**].  In the Catheterization Laboratory, normal filling pressures were demonstrated.  Left ventricular gram demonstrated ejection fraction of 50-55% with mild anterior/inferior HK.  Coronary arteries revealed: right dominant with left main coronary artery 40% distal, left anterior descending with a mid-70% lesion, left circumferential 40% proximal lesion, right coronary artery totally occluded to mid-vessel, saphenous vein graft to diagonal graft with an ostial 90% lesion and a 70% mid-lesion, saphenous vein graft to posterior descending artery graft with serial focal stenosis, maximum of 90%.  The patient had a free right internal mammary artery to left anterior descending which was occluded.  The patient underwent intervention of the saphenous vein graft to diagonal lesion which proved to be a complex intervention, as the case was complicated by no reflow in the distal vasculature following the mid-stent placement.  This was successfully treated with intracoronary vasodilator administration and anticoagulation.  Final angiography demonstrated no residual stenosis, no dissection, and TIMI 3 flow.  The patient was chest pain free at the end of the case, however, a prophylactic intra-aortic balloon pump was placed at that time.  Subsequent to this initial procedure, the patient had recurrent angina with ischemic electrocardiogram changes and was taken back to the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory for emergent re-look angiography.   Angiography at that time revealed a patent saphenous vein graft to diagonal with TIMI 2 flow, which was treated with intracoronary vasodilation with near normalization of flow to selective left internal mammary artery.  Angiography revealed a native left internal mammary artery without stenosis.  The patient subsequently transferred to the Cardiac Care Unit for further monitoring.\\n\\nMEDICAL HISTORY: 1.

She has a past medical history significant for HIV and hepatitis C seropositivity.  A liver biopsy in [**2196-2-1**] revealed the presence of grade 2 inflammation and Stage II-III fibrosis. Prior to admission, the patient had been receiving a course of PEG-interferon and ribavirin for her hepatitis C.  She was also taking Trizivir antiretroviral therapy for HIV.  She initially presented to the ED on [**4-1**] with a three week history of sore throat, pain with swallowing, nasal congestion, cough productive of white sputum, nausea, vomiting, and painful swelling of the left lower extremity. She reports taking [**1-6**] Extra Strength Tylenol every four hours for several weeks for management of her painful symptoms.  On admission, she was found to be in acute liver failure with AST of 2,158, ALT 948, total bilirubin 6.0, and alkaline phosphatase of 142.  She was additionally found to have pancreatitis with amylase in the 400's and lipase in the 300's.  She was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] and stayed there for seven days and before being transferred to the floor on the [**Hospital Ward Name 516**]. A summary of her medical problems up until time of transfer to the [**Hospital Ward Name 517**] is as follows:  1. Liver disease/pancreatitis:  The patient's acute liver failure was attributed to Tylenol toxicity in the setting of chronic liver disease secondary to hepatitis C.  She was treated with intravenous N-acetylcysteine and her antiretroviral therapy was held.  With treatment her liver function tests improved.  The pancreatitis was also attributed to acetaminophen toxicity by the Toxicology consult service.  Her amylase and lipase also improved with treatment.  Complications of her liver failure included thrombocytopenia, impaired synthetic function with coagulopathy and hypoalbuminemia, and portal hypertension with ascites and splenomegaly.  The patient's peak INR was 4.6 on [**4-2**] and her peak PTT was 80 on [**4-16**].  She developed epistaxis as well as grossly bloody stools in the course of her hospital stay.  She received several units of fresh-frozen plasma and was transfused a unit of packed red cells for a drop in her hematocrit to 24.2 on [**4-8**].  A MRCP was performed to evaluate for additional causes of pancreatitis and/or obstructive biliary disease.  This study was negative for obstruction of the bile ducts, but did show evidence of acute liver inflammation as well as portal hypertension.  The pancreas appeared normal.  Patient had a brief period of hepatic encephalopathy with confusion and asterixis.  She was placed on lactulose with an appropriate increase in stool output and resolution of her confusion and asterixis.  2. Cellulitis:  The patient received an ultrasound evaluation of the left lower extremity for her pain, erythema, and swelling on [**2200-4-3**].  This study revealed an area of tracking subcutaneous edema, but no deep vein thrombosis.  The clinical picture was felt to be most consistent with cellulitis, and the patient was started on cefazolin.  This antibiotic was changed to Unasyn when the patient did not appear to respond.  As of time of transfer to the [**Hospital Ward Name 12053**], the patient was on day 10 of IV Unasyn.  3. Pharyngitis:  The patient was initially felt to most likely have a viral supraglottitis.  The ENT service was consulted and after an evaluation with laryngoscopy, they recommended administration of a proton-pump inhibitor for potential laryngeal reflux.  They also recommended starting nystatin for empiric treatment of [**Female First Name (un) **] esophagitis.  Swabs for viral culture were obtained and at time of transfer to the [**Hospital Ward Name 517**], had not revealed the presence of a viral infection.  4. Skin changes:  The patient had two bullous skin lesions on her back on admission.  She was evaluated by the Dermatology service.  A biopsy revealed changes consistent with bullous impetigo.  The consult recommended initiating topical mupirocin in addition to sterile dressings.  5. HIV:  Patient's HAART was held on admission because of her liver failure.  A CD4 count was drawn on [**4-2**] and returned at 574.  In summary, the patient's main issues at time of transfer to the [**Hospital Ward Name 517**] were her continued liver failure, GI bleed of unknown source, persistent left lower extremity cellulitis, and persistent sore throat.  She was transferred to be followed more closely by the Hepatology service.\\n\\nMEDICAL HISTORY: 1. HIV diagnosed in [**2194**] when the patient requested in-[**Last Name (un) 5153**] fertilization.

Catheterization done on [**12-28**] showed an EF of 65%, left main of 60 to 70%, left anterior descending coronary artery 70% and LVEDP of 22.  Please see catheterization report for full details.  The patient is admitted to the Cardiothoracic Service as an outpatient admission and admitted directly to the Operating Room on [**1-5**].  At that time the patient came to the Operating Room where he underwent coronary artery bypass grafting times two.  Please see the operative report for full details.  In summary, the patient had a coronary artery bypass graft times two with a left internal mammary coronary artery to the left anterior descending coronary artery and an saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal. He tolerated the operation well and was transferred from the Operating Room to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit.  At the time of transfer the patient had  an arteriole line, two atrial pacing wires, two mediastinal and one left pleural chest tube.  He was transferred with Propofol infusing at 30 mics per kilogram per minute.  His mean arteriole pressure was 85.  His CVP was 5.  He was in normal sinus rhythm.  The patient did well in the immediate postoperative period.  He was allowed to awaken from his anesthesia and was appropriately responsive weaning from the ventilator at which time the patient was noted to have increasing frequency of premature ventricular contractions and increasing episodes of premature ventricular contractions quickly accelerated to ventricular tachycardia and then to ventricular fibrillation. The patient was resuscitated from his ventricular fibrillation.  Please see the resuscitation report for full details.  Following resuscitation the patient was transferred to the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory where he underwent cardiac catheterization to assess the patency of his new coronary artery bypass graft.  Once in the Catheterization Laboratory the patient was found to have a widely patent left internal mammary coronary artery to the left anterior descending coronary artery and the saphenous vein graft to left circumflex was patent with an 80% narrowing immediately antegrade and distal to the anastomosis.  This narrowing improved, but did not fully normalize with intragraft intravenous nitroglycerin and Diltiazem.  An intra-aortic balloon pump was also placed while the patient was in the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory.  The patient was transferred from the Catheterization Laboratory back to the Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit.  The patient returned to the Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit in good condition.  At the time of transfer his medications included neo-synephrine and Propofol.  He remained hemodynamically stable overnight without any further episodes of ventricular ectopy.  On the morning of postoperatively day one his Propofol was weaned to off.  He was weaned from the ventilator and extubated.  Following that the intra-aortic balloon pump was weaned and ultimately discontinued also on postoperative day one.  The patient remained hemodynamically stable without any further episodes of ventricular ectopy throughout the remainder of postoperative day one.  On postoperative day two the patient was transferred from the Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit to Far Six for continuing postoperative care and cardiac rehabilitation.  Over the next several days the patient's activity level was progressively increased with the assistance of physical therapy and the nursing staff.  His diet was advanced to regular.  He remained hemodynamically stable with no further episodes of ventricular ectopy.  On postoperative day five the patient's activity level had progressed to a level five, which is ambulating 500 feet and up a flight of stairs.  He remained hemodynamically stable and it was decided that he was stable and ready for discharge.\\n\\nMEDICAL HISTORY: \\n\\nMEDICATION ON ADMISSION: \\n\\nALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.\\n\\nPHYSICAL EXAM: \\n\\nFAMILY HISTORY: \\n\\nSOCIAL HISTORY: \",\n",
