No urine incontinence or e/o toxidromes. Labs notable for EtOH 86, Osms 366, anion gap 16, lactate 3.8. Utox positive for barbs, but Stox and Utox otherwise negative. Given high serum osmolar gap (60), toxicology was consulted for concern of toxic alcohol ingestion. Most likely isopropyl alcohol given osmolar gap with small anion gap (likely due to lactate) and access to CalStat in the hospital today. However, given a dose of Fomepizole 15mg/kg IVx1 in the ED for possible ethylene glycol vs methanol ingestion. Also given Diazepam 10mg x1 for EtOH withdrawal.

The patient was visiting his partner in the ICU earlier today. He was awake and conversant in the morning with no acute complaints. He was noted to be sleeping on the floor, but walked to the chair by himself when he was awakened. Later in the afternoon, the patient was noted to still be asleep in the chair. He was unarousable with verbal stimuli or sternal rub, so he was taken down to the ED. . In the ED, the patient was initially altered, but was otherwise hemodynamically stable. No urine incontinence or e/o toxidromes. Labs notable for EtOH 86, Osms 366, anion gap 16, lactate 3.8. Utox positive for barbs, but Stox and Utox otherwise negative. Given high serum osmolar gap (60), toxicology was consulted for concern of toxic alcohol ingestion. Most likely isopropyl alcohol given osmolar gap with small anion gap (likely due to lactate) and access to CalStat in the hospital today. However, given a dose of Fomepizole 15mg/kg IVx1 in the ED for possible ethylene glycol vs methanol ingestion. Also given Diazepam 10mg x1 for EtOH withdrawal.

He was recently noted to have been started on tetracycline in the outpatient setting then subsequently developed these symptoms.

A Head CT was done and showed an extensive SDH extending along the tentorium, largest along the R frontal convexity. Neurosurgery was consulted. = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = ================================================================ HPI from transfer to general medicine service: HPI: Mr. [**Known lastname 9449**] is an 87 y/o M with hx of CAD s/p CABG in [**2187**], SSS s/p PPM, atrial fibrillation on coumadin who presented to OSH on [**6-8**] with FTT, found to have bilateral SDH, and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for neurosurgical evacuation, currently POD#13. He was transferred to the MICU for increasing oxygen requirement and respiratory distress. . Hospital Course: The patient was previously living in an [**Hospital3 **] facility, independent with a baseline mental status of AOx3, and independent ambulation with mechanical limbs. The patient has has many falls in the past, and recently had a fall one month ago getting out of bed because he was not wearing his prosthetics at the time. Per discussion with his family, the patient had been complaining of symptoms of failure to thrive over the past two months prior to admission including fatigue and anorexia/decreased PO intake associated with dysphagia that has been present since he was intubated for his CABG a few years ago. A few weeks prior to admission, his symptoms worsened to include SOB, weakness, and headache. He saw his PCP two times prior to admission (once on [**5-29**] and had a Head CT that was negative at the time and once the day of his OSH admission). He had also been started on TCNs by his dermatologist for a presumed total body skin infection (doxycycline on [**5-8**], changed to minocycline after 2 days due to nausea, stopped after 10 days of treatment). Not taking meds for 3-4 days prior to admission. He presented to [**Hospital3 **] on [**6-6**] after being seen by his PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was found to have an INR of 5.9. He also reported galactorrhea for which is his spiranolactone was held. His dysphagia was treated with Reglan, PPI, and he had a barium swallow. He became aggitated and combative and a head CT showed bilateral subdural hematomas. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] neurosurgical service for further care.  . On [**6-9**] he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] and had a R crainiotomy to relieve the subdural hematoma. He was in the SICU and intubated from [**6-10**] for OR to [**6-11**]. He was extubated successfully but had a high O2 requirement on a face tent. He was noted to be less arousable, and a head CT was performed which showed stable subdural, subarachnoid and intraventricular hemorrhage and an ABG demonstrated a mixed respiratory and metabolic alkalosis (7.57/27/106/25). His subdural drain was d/c-ed on [**6-12**]. He was noted on [**6-16**] to have hypoxia to 88% which improved with 20 of IV lasix and increase in O2 requirement to 4 L NC. His Keppra was stopped on [**6-17**]. His mental status was noted to be waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] during his post-operative course, at some points noted to be more lucid by his family 2 days prior to MICU transfer, but never returning to his baseline pre-operative mental status. On [**6-19**], patient had a speech and swallow consult which demonstrated diminished swallowing capacity with signs/symptoms of aspiration in the setting of altered mental status. However, decision was made to place a PEG for temporary nutrition to improve his healing post-operatively (with the understanding that it was not be a permanent method of nutrition, as patient has not desired this on previous admissions). He had 2 Head CTs post-op that showed stability/improvemnt of SDH, but a repeat Head CT on [**6-20**] demonstrated a new R infarction of the right medial temporo-occipital region, in the PCA territory, thought to be thrombo-embolic in the setting of his AF and lack of anticoagulation. . The day of transfer, the patient was noted to spike a low grade fever, more respiratory distress, with continued desaturations down to 80% on 70% face mask, and onset of tachycardia to 140s. He received deep suctioning without effect on his oxygenation, and lasix 10 mg IV x1 with resultant hypotension to 80s ((previously SBPs of 100s on the floor) so no further diuresis was performed. MERIT was consulted for treatment of his hypoxia and tachycardia, and recommended starting Vancomycin and Zosyn, and continuing his lasix 20 mg PO daily and metoprolol 50 mg PO BID (did not recommend up-titration due to his low blood pressures). However, the patient's hypoxia, tachycardia, and hypotension persisted, resulting in MICU consultation and transfer. . Pt.s respiratory distress improved and doboff tube placement was initially successful but pt. pulled out tube. It was retried several times but unsuccessful.\\n\\nMEDICAL HISTORY: CAD, s/p CABG, Sick sinus syndrome requiring pacer, AAA s/p repair. PVD, s/p Rt BKA and left TMA.

The EKG from that office is unavailable, but patient stated that Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3357**] told him that back pain such as his could be a sign of an MI and he was sent to [**Hospital1 18**] ED for evaluation.  Patient states that last thursday he was swimming in the pool, as he usually does for 40 minutes, afterwards went to the sauna, and once he was done was wiping his sweat and felt that he had some back pain while moving his arms about. He states that the pain was different from the usual musculoskeletal pain that he gets with movement (around his ribs in the axilla, which he had for years). The pain never went away and was worse with movement, especially with movement of back muscles. The area between the scapulas is also slightly tender to deep palpation. What helps is the Solaraze gel (diclofenac) cream that he got from a Russian doctor [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 15158**]. The help subsides but never goes away completely. His current pain is not associated with diaphoresis, does not radiate to his arm, neck or jaw. He does not report dysphagia, or trouble walking. Patient states that at baseline he can walk for as far as the eye can see, and his swims quite regularly. He has had a nuclear exercise stress test in [**2134**] when his complaint of rib pain was further evaluated, At peak exercise (mid Stage 2 onset) there was 3.0-3.5 mm of gradual upsloping, horizontal ST segment depression noted in V4-V6 and inferiorly. In recovery (minute 1 onset) these ST depressions became diffusely downsloping before resolving gradually with rest by minute 10. Of note, the exercise induced ST depressions were noted in the setting of baseline prominent voltage in the absence of strain. Appropriate hemodynamic response to physiologic stress. IMPRESSION; Marked ischemic EKG changes in the setting of prominent voltage. No anginal symptoms. On nuclear report the following findings were identified: 1. Mild reversible perfusion defect involving inferolateral wall. 2. Normal left ventricular size, EF 48%. . In the ED, initial vitals were 98.6-74-140/80-14-99%2L  . Labs were significant for  Trop neg x 1. Concern is \\\"high risk\\\" so getting admitted.  CXR without acute process.  Gave ASA 325 mg. . EKG in the ED: Sinus at 52, 1st degree AV block, ST elevations in V2, V3 . On arrival to the floor, patient was complaining of mild back pain with movement, but otherwise had no complaints. His vitals were 97.7-140/93-58-18-95% . REVIEW OF SYSTEMS On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of systems were negative. .

She had 2 embryos implanted on Monday in her first cycle of IVF. She had ongoing abdominal pain since the Friday before and had been seen at [**Hospital6 33**] although it is not clear what happened there. On the morning of admission she started feeling short of breath, cough, and pleuritic chest pain that radiated to her back. She took two puffs of her ProAir which did not significantly help. Her shortness of breath got worse and so she called EMS.  When EMS arrived they administered an epi pen, nebulizers and magnesium given concern for an allergic reaction or asthma. At the outside hospital they started her on steroids. They also did a CT chest w/contrast to rule out a dissecting aortic aneurysm given her description of the pain. The timing of the contrast however was unable to evaluate for a PE. An ABG at OSH showed a respiratory alkalosis. She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further workup.  On arrival at [**Hospital1 18**] she was breathing in the 60s and noted to be very anxious. She had an expiratory wheeze that was felt to be forced due to her tachypnia.

On [**2120-5-31**], she suffered an L1 burst fracture and left rib fracture secondary to a fall from a ten foot ladder (per patient) or from a second-floor window (per patient's daughter) at home. She was initially seen at an outside hospital two days later, after the incident.  She was transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] immediately for surgical intervention.  She had a relatively uneventful perioperative course except for one unit of packed red blood cell transfusion postoperatively.  She had a total L1 vertebrectomy, fusion and segmental instrumentation of T12 to L3, cage placement at L1, and autograft during the first surgery.  She was evaluated by Psychiatry at that time for possible paranoia and questionable suicidal ideation postoperatively. Medical workup at that time included a negative RPR, normal thyroid function tests, and a head MRI showing possible chronic microvascular ischemia.  She was sent to a rehabilitation facility on [**2120-6-7**], in stable condition.  About one month later, on [**2120-7-9**], she was readmitted for elective second operation to correct kyphoscoliosis.  Again she had an uneventful operative course.  The second operation included a posterior fusion of T9 to L3, multiple thoracolumbar laminectomies, segmental instrumentation of T9 to L3, and right iliac crest graft. Postoperatively, however, she suddenly decompensated in the Post-Anesthesia Care Unit while she was receiving a transfusion of one unit of packed red blood cells.  She complained of sudden onset of chest pain and shortness of breath with oxygen saturations dropping to 70%, blood pressure dropping to 70/40.  She was intubated immediately, and transferred to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit for further management.  Progressive loss of bilateral translucency on chest x-ray and positive anti-HLA and anti-granulocyte antibodies on hematological workup were all consistent with TRALI (transfusion-associated lung injury). While in the Surgical Intensive Care Unit, her postoperative course was further complicated with methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus bacteremia, pneumonia, and wound infection (which were documented with positive cultures on [**7-17**]).   These events eventually led to a prolonged intubation.  After she was started on intravenous oxacillin on [**7-20**], she had very good response, with decreased fever and decreased white blood cell count, as well as clearing of bacteremia which was documented by several blood cultures drawn on later days.  She also underwent incision and drainage of posterior wounds on [**7-23**].  Wound cultures showed decreased colonization of methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus and rare colonies of E. coli.  She also had a diagnostic pleural tap on [**7-26**] for persistent left pleural effusion.  The final culture was negative.  She had repeated TTE on [**7-22**] which showed no vegetation and left ventricular ejection fraction greater than 55%.  She also had a CT of the chest, abdomen and pelvis on [**7-25**], which showed improving effusion and normal bowels with old splenic infarct.  CT angio was also performed, which showed improving atelectasis and effusion without evidence of pulmonary emboli.  She was extubated on [**7-28**], and transferred to Medicine on [**7-30**] in stable condition.\\n\\nMEDICAL HISTORY: Uterine fibroids\\n\\nMEDICATION ON ADMISSION: \\n\\nALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.\\n\\nPHYSICAL EXAM: \\n\\nFAMILY HISTORY: Schizophrenia\\n\\nSOCIAL HISTORY: Works full-time as an insurance underwriter.

He was diagnosed with PMR and started on prednisone with improvement in his symptoms. During the preceding six months, he reported a history of the generalized body pain as well as fatigue, weakness, and poor appetite. He also reported periodic fevers, drenching night sweats, and a 25-pound weight loss also over the same six months. Marked improvement of both his musculoskeletal and constitutional symptoms after prednisone treatment. He then presented to the emergency room on [**2197-7-17**] with palpitations and dizziness and was found to be in atrial fibrillation. He has had a history of PAF in the past. He was febrile to 101.6 with a heart rate of 126. CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis on showed multiple low-attenuation lesions within the liver, spleen, and kidneys with characteristics felt atypical for lymphoma. A follow-up MRI of the abdomen showed hypovascular masses in both kidneys and spleen of various sizes consistent with lymphoma. Mr. [**Known lastname **] then underwent bone marrow aspirate and biopsy on [**2197-7-26**], which showed extensive necrosis with focal involvement by a high-grade B-cell lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell type. FISH translocation was notable for c-Myc and Bcl-2 indicating a \\\"double hit\\\" lymphoma characterized by a Burkitt's-like lymphoma. . Mr. [**Known lastname **] has overall tolerated his chemotherapy relatively well. He has continued on his Fondaparinux daily when on [**2197-11-16**], he noted sudden onset sudden of a dark cover in the lower half of the visual field in his right eye, which lasted [**10-20**] minutes, then self-resolved. He presented to the emergency room for evaluation. TEE revealed thrombus at the tip of his right atrial catheter, with no PFO. Ophthalmology work up was negative and the episode was attributed to TIA with recommendation to continue fondaparinux. He was discharged on [**2197-11-18**] with no further episodes. . TREATMENT HISTORY: 1. Initiated treatment with [**Hospital1 **] chemotherapy on [**2197-7-29**] with two doses of Rituxan on [**2197-8-2**] and [**2197-8-3**]. Follow up CT imaging on [**2197-8-5**] showed stable lymphomatous lesions in the kidney, spleen, and abdominal nodes. 2. Rituxan 500 mg given on [**2197-8-10**] with a fever that evening and admission for neutropenia. During admission, noted for atrial fibrillation with RVR and was started on digoxin at 0.125 mg daily along with metoprolol 200 mg daily. 3. Readmitted on [**2197-8-18**] for his second cycle of [**Hospital1 **] chemotherapy, which was delayed for two days due to hypotension and cough. A CT of the chest showed bilateral lower lobe opacities, right greater than left, concerning for infection and he was treated with a course of Levaquin. 4. On [**2197-8-30**], received Rituxan at 375 mg/m2. 5. Follow up PET scan on [**2194-9-6**] showed no evidence for lymphoma but was notable for multiple peripheral base pulmonary opacities with rims of soft tissue density and relative central lucencies most of which were new. He underwent CT of the chest for further evaluation, which showed multiple filling defects within the segmental and subsegmental branches of the right lower lobe arteries compatible with pulmonary emboli. 6. Admitted on [**2197-9-7**] for initiation of anticoagulation with fondaparinux and began third cycle of treatment with [**Hospital1 **] on [**2197-9-8**](dose level 2) 7.

Admitted on [**2197-11-23**] for high-dose cyclophosphamide. 12. Admitted on [**2198-1-15**] for IVAC (originally admitted for high-dose MTX, but PET scan showed progressive disease). . OTHER MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, Burkitt's like with c-Myc and Bcl-2 positivity s/p [**Hospital1 **] x 5 cycles and multiple rituxan infusions. He has had recurrent disease within 2 - 3 months of his last treatment. Patient recently admitted [**Date range (3) 21959**] for CNS prophylaxis with high-dose MTX for his aggressive lymphoma. However, PET scan prior to admission was concerning for rapidly progressive disease and CT torso on admission agreed with these findings and his LDH continued to rise. He was therefore started on IVAC chemotherapy x5 days and discharged on neupogen. 2. PAF diagnosed in [**2180**] with now chronic atrial fibrillation in the past several months. He had no history of treatment with anti-arrhythmia or anticoagulation prior to his admission in [**8-/2197**], currently receiving treatment with metoprolol and digoxin. 3.

Starting on Tuesday of last week (6 days prior to admission), he started feeling nauseous and weak, had loss of appetite, and had some vomiting. This improved by Saturday, and on Saturday he had enough of an appetite to eat a hamburger, and enough energy to go out with his family, which he had not had previously. On Sunday he began feeling nauseous again, and started having abdominal pain which continued to worsen and became quite severe by Monday morning. He was also having severe shaking chills throughout Sunday during the day and night. He again had anorexia. He presented to [**Hospital3 3583**], where one note suggests a temp of 105.9;; a RUQ U/S showed a dilated CBD and liver labs confirmed an infectious (notable bandemia) and cholestatic (high bilirubin, etc) picture consistent with cholangitis. .

At this time, an EKG was obtained, which demonstrated likely inferior infarct with inferior Q waves and ST segment elevations.  The patient was started on aspirin, Plavix, sublingual nitroglycerin, and nitroglycerin drip.  On this regimen, the patient had persistent chest pain.  In addition, his blood pressure markedly decreased.  The patient was then started on IV fluids and thrombolytic therapy.

He drank large quantities of port wine and took extra medications reportedly \\\"by mistake.\\\" The partner is pretty sure that the patient was intoxicated when he multiple tablets of wellbutrin, seroquel, propranolol and klonipin but he is uncertain of specific amount. He later stated that he was not absolutely certain whether the patient actually ingested any wellbutrin and propanolol. Ultimately, the amount and combination of pills taken was unclear. The patient's longtime partner of nearly thirty years came home and found him semi-alert and called EMS immediately. . According to his partner, Mr. [**Known lastname 6418**] had been coughing/wheezing for several months now but had no complaints of fevers or chills.  He had been complaining about pain in his neck since a fall down a few stairs a few days prior to this current incident. . In our ED, initial vital signs were T97.3 BP 90/54 HR 68 RR 12 oxygen saturation of 95% via NRB. He was placed on NRB for low oxygen saturations <90. He was somnolent on arrival to hospital but still responsive to tactile stimuli.  Fingerstick glucose was 140 on arrival. He quickly became hypotensive to SBP 73/47. He was given IVF x3L total. EKG was normal, without any alarming ST changes. Peripheral dopamine was started for rapid BP correction and he was intubated for hypoxia and airway protection. Toxicology consult was called and they recommended that the pressor choice be switched to Levofed. He was also given narcan x2 with no effect. Once the medication history was flushed out, he was given calcium which did increase his rate from 58 to 88 and his SBP increased by 10. He was given glucagon 1mg with no further effect. Toxicology consult recommended trying high dose glucagon 5mg and if that works, starting a glucagon gtt at 1-5mg/hr. They also recommend serial EKGs for monitoring.  He was also given Vancomycin and Ceftriaxone due to initial concern for possible sepsis. . He had chest xray which showed question widened mediastinum and patient reported some chest discomfort on arrival. CTA was done which showed normal aorta. FAST scan was done which showed no pericardial effusion, and no intra-abdominal bleeds.  CXR/CT did show bilateral infiltrates consistent with an aspiration. Hemodynamic instability was worrisome and he was transferred to the intensive care unit for close monitoring. . On arrival to the ICU he was hypoxic with O2 saturation of 85% on FIO2 of 50%, HR in 50's.  He was suctioned, ET tube pulled back 2cm and PEEP increased to 14, FIO2 to 100% with slow recovery of O2 saturation.

Apparently, patient presented on [**4-18**] at [**Hospital3 **] with acute renal failure, hyperkalemic with K of 7.3 and hyponatremic with a sodium of 130.  During workup of patient's acute renal failure at [**Hospital3 **], patient had an abdominal CT, which showed bilateral adrenal masses measuring up to 7.5 cm in AP diameter on the left and 6 cm in AP diameter on the right.  Patient was then discharged and represented for an adrenal mass biopsy on [**4-28**], and was sent back to [**Hospital1 **] Transitional Care Unit.  On [**4-29**], then patient then developed tachycardia and fever at [**Hospital3 **].  Chest x- ray was consistent with CHF.  Patient was given nitro paste and Lasix, and then became hypotensive to the 60's. Dobutamine was started at outside hospital and patient received levofloxacin for a question of UTI as well as vancomycin.  She was also given a dose of Solu-Medrol for a question of adrenal insufficiency.  Prior to Solu-Medrol administration, serum cortisol was checked at outside hospital and was low at 13.  Patient also had an aldosterone checked at that time, which was low at 3.0, normal range is 4 to 31.  Patient was started on dobutamine and dopamine at the outside hospital.  Dobutamine was then discontinued and Neo- Synephrine was started.  Patient had only received a 250 cc normal saline bolus prior to the start of pressors. Abdominal CT scan was performed, which showed no bleed.  The patient was then at this point transferred to the [**Hospital1 346**] Medical Intensive Care Unit for further management.  On arrival to the MICU, patient was on dopamine and Neo- Synephrine, and her blood pressure was 81/39, heart rate 120s, and was saturating 100 percent on nonrebreather.

She was being worked up for chronic nausea, vomitting, and epigastric pain, for which she had a RUQ U/S on [**1-18**] which showed sludge in the gallbladder and a prominent pancreatic duct with a possible stricture in the head of the pancreas, and dilation of the common bile duct. This was confirmed by MRCP.  She thus underwent an ERCP on [**2179-3-8**] for further evaluation.  The ERCP showed a dilated common bile duct, ductal ectasia and evidence of mild chronic pancreatitis.  No sphincterotomy was done, only brushings.  Unfortunately post procedure the patient developed acute abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.  Labs revealed an acute pancreatitis with [**Doctor First Name **]/lip of 2100/1500, respectively.  A CT scan revealed non-enhancement of the body and tail of the pancreas, consistent with necrosis.  She was treated with antibiotics, aggressive IVF, and a dilaudid PCA, but developed an O2 requirement, mild ARF, and a significant leukocytosis, though she remained afebrile and hemodynamically stable.

He awoke and was doing some work at his desk when he leaned over to get some papers and fell to the ground secondary to left sided weakness.  He could not do anything with the left arm at all and had some movement of the left leg.  He could not bear weight on the left leg.  He lay on the ground for a few hours until his son came home and called 911.  He denied any headaches, nausea, vomiting, numbness or tingling.  He stated that he thought he had double vision intermittently, but could not be more specific.  The double image was of objects seen side to side, but he could not say if any particular direction of gaze made this worse.  He was seen in the Emergency Department by the neurology and stroke service where his exam was notable for a right gaze preference, left homonymous hemianopia versus left hemi-spacial visual neglect, a left facial droop, flaccid left arm with strength in all muscle groups except for minimal movement of the fingers and 4 to 4+/5 strength in left hip flexion and hamstrings.  There was minimal left foot dorsiflexion.  There was extinction to double .............. stimulation on the left.  An MRI revealed a 2 cm right sided basal ganglia bleed with some extension to the thalamus.  His blood pressure initially was 190/110, so he was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit for intravenous labetalol and frequent neurologic checks.  He did well over the first night with rapidly improved strength in the left arm.  He no longer had any complaints of diplopia.  He was therefore transferred to the neurology floor for further care.\\n\\nMEDICAL HISTORY: 1.

ABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender, nondistended. EXTREMITIES:  Warm without cyanosis, clubbing or edema. NEUROLOGIC:  He was alert, oriented and attentive.  He was able to do the months of the year backwards without difficulty.  Language was fluent with intact naming, [**Location (un) 1131**], repetition and comprehension.  Praxis was normal and there was no right left confusion.  Cranial nerve exam:  The right pupil was 1.5 mm, left 2 mm.  Both were reactive to light. Visual fields were full, though he explores the left hemi-space less and requires encouragement to look to the left.  Extraocular movements revealed some limitation of vertical gaze with both up and down gaze.  There was some improvement to down gaze with vestibular ocular reflex (tilting head backwards).  Smooth pursuit was interrupted by saccades when pursuing to the right.  Saccadic eye movements were hypometric to the left.  There is a flattened nasolabial fold on the left.  Sensation was intact in the face.  Tongue and palate movements were normal.  Sternocleidomastoid and trapezius were full.  Bulk and tone were full.  There was a left pronator drift and isolated asterixis of the left hand, as well as occasional myoclonic movements of the left hand. Strength was [**3-12**] in the left deltoid, 5-/5 triceps, 4+/5 finger extensors and hand intrinsics.  Strength was full in the left lower extremity and muscle groups on the right were full.  Reflexes were 3+ on the left, 2+ on the right in both the arms and legs.  There was a withdrawal response to plantar stimulation with the left foot, but right plantar reflex was flexor.  Pinprick was mildly decreased in a patchy distribution over the left arm and leg.  Joint position sense was intact throughout.  Vibration was decreased to the knees bilaterally.  Rapid alternating movements and fine finger movements were slow on the left.  There was some dysmetria out of proportion to weakness with finger to nose testing on the left arm.  MRI revealed acute hemorrhage in the right basal ganglia extending into the thalamus.  There was changes of small vessel disease.  There was absence of flow signal in the right intracranial internal carotid artery with markedly diminished flow signal within the right middle cerebral and anterior cerebral arteries.\\n\\nFAMILY HISTORY: \\n\\nSOCIAL HISTORY: More than 50 pack year smoker, drinks one to two cans of beer per day, works as a doorman a few days per week and lives with his wife.

The patient reported that, over the past three to four weeks, he had been experiencing chest pressure while playing volleyball.  He also noted once, while carrying boxes up and down the stairs, he had anginal type symptoms that relented after stopping exertion.  He denied any chest discomfort at rest, however.  The patient was referred to Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] for a stress test on [**2132-10-22**].  He exercised for approximately five minutes on [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] protocol and had 3 to [**Street Address(2) 45253**] depression and chest pain.  His blood pressure dropped from 160 systolic to 100 systolic and was therefore referred for cardiac catheterization to further evaluate this.  At the time of cardiac catheterization on [**2132-10-22**], the catheterization showed severe three vessel disease, including a totally occluded left anterior descending artery in a diabetic, with a normal left ventricular ejection fraction.  The patient likely require revascularization versus percutaneous intervention given the fact that his left anterior descending artery, right coronary artery and left circumflex were all involved.  With diabetes, his mortality benefit was much greater with coronary artery bypass grafting, particularly in the setting of three vessel disease and left internal mammary artery replacing his left anterior descending artery lesion would give him an excellent revascularization potential.  The left main coronary artery was not obstructed.  The left anterior descending artery was totally occluded proximally, filled back to the proximal left anterior descending artery via collaterals from the right coronary artery.  The left circumflex was not obstructed.  The obtuse marginal one had an 80% proximal stenosis, obtuse marginal two had an 80% mid-vessel stenosis and the right coronary artery had an 85% to 90% mid-vessel lesion.  The right coronary artery filled with the left anterior descending artery back to its proximal aspect by right-to-left collaterals.  The patient was therefore admitted on [**2132-10-23**] and was seen by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 70**], who stated that the patient was an excellent candidate for coronary artery bypass grafting.  The patient's preoperative hematocrit was 42.5, BUN and creatinine 15 and 1.2, and INR 0.76.  His chest x-ray showed no acute cardiopulmonary disease.  Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm, no Q waves, and no ST-T segment changes were noted at this time.\\n\\nMEDICAL HISTORY: 1.  Noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus times three years.  2.

The patient was in her usual state of health until one day prior to admission when she began experiencing chest pain and shortness of breath.  The patient took 10 sublingual nitroglycerin tablets for chest pain.  She went to [**Hospital6 4299**] where was intubated and started on intravenous nitroglycerin, heparin, and given Lasix and levofloxacin.  A chest computed tomography was done to rule out dissection and was negative.  The patient became hypotensive with nitroglycerin, so she was switched to nitroglycerin paste. her first set of cardiac enzymes was negative.  An electrocardiogram revealed a left bundle-branch block (which was old).  An arterial blood gas revealed a pH of 7.33, a PCO2 of 41, and a PO2 of 185 on an FIO2 of 1.  A computed tomography scan showed bilateral pleural effusions with a pericardial effusion and a thoracic aortic aneurysm.  The chest x-ray showed left lower lobe and left lingular collapse.  The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] for a bronchoscopy.  On arrival, the patient's vital signs were stable.  A bronchoscopy was performed which showed moderate secretions in the posterior right lower lobe and a left upper and left lower lobe obstruction by a mucous plug. The mucous plug was aspirated, and a repeat chest film showed re-inflation of the lung.  A bronchoalveolar lavage specimen showed 2+ polymorphonuclear lymphocytes and no organisms.  The patient was initially hypertensive on admission.  She was given fluids and Lopressor.  She then experienced transient hypotension which led to an emergent echocardiogram which showed 4-chamber enlargement, severely depressed left ventricular function with an ejection fraction of 20%, a large pleural effusion, and a moderate pericardial effusion without echocardiogram evidence of tamponade.  There was also severe aortic insufficiency, mild mitral regurgitation, and mild tricuspid regurgitation, with a dilated aortic root.  The patient ruled in for a myocardial infarction by cardiac enzymes with a peak troponin of 0.83, and a heparin drip was started.  The patient then developed hematuria, and as the troponin leak was thought to be due to demand ischemia the heparin was dropped.  The patient's respiratory status improved, and the patient was extubated and transferred to the floor.  The patient had been hypertensive and was treated with hydralazine.  Initially, the patient's ACE inhibitor was held for acute renal failure.\\n\\nMEDICAL HISTORY: 1.  Coronary artery disease. 2.

He was admitted on [**2191-8-12**] after a fall resulting in acute on chronic SDH on the left; his course is complicated by seizure and he has been started on fosphenytoin & phenytoin.  This evening he was noted to be in acute respiratory distress with desats to the low to mid 90's on 3LNC (reportedly desatting to the mid 70's on room air; has had a variable O2 requirement since being admitted).  His blood pressure dropped to the 70's systolic and was responsive to the 80's and then 100's after a 250 cc NS bolus.  he was febrile to 101.9.  The neurology and medicine MERIT teams were concerned for an aspiration event vs. volume overload vs. PE.  CXR is c/w volume overload; however it is grossly unchanged from earlier films.  His normal schedule is M-W-F though he did not get dialyzed on Friday [**8-19**] because he was having focal motor seizures.  He was last dialyzed Saturday [**2191-8-20**] for a shorter cycle b/c of low blood flow from the HD catheter(per renal note).  His mental status has been poor since being in the hospital.  Of note, on arrival to MICU pt was being treated with vanco/gent for a possible line infection given recent fevers.  Nothing has grown out of numerous blood cultures since [**2191-8-12**] yet he continues to spike.  he was briefly in MICU green on [**8-17**] - [**8-18**] for fevers and hypotension to the 70's.  Since arriving to the MICU satting in the upper 90's on NRB, code status was confirmed with his wife on the phone and he was intubated with vecuronium and etomidate.

The pain became increasingly more severe and erythema began to spread. On presentation in the emergency room the patient was profoundly tachycardic with significant amounts of cellulitis without crepitance in his right thigh. There was an area of prominence near his perineum which was concerning. However, there was no evidence of any gas within the tissue. The area did not appear to involve the rectum. The patient was treated aggressively with intravenous fluid hydration, intravenous antibiotics and the patient was observed to see if his cellulitis would decrease. This was observed for several hours and the cellulitis indeed on the outer thigh did improve. However, upon serial examinations there appeared to be an area near his middle inner thigh close to the inguinal ligament that remained persistently erythematous and persistently tender. There was also new noted bogginess and edema of the tissue below it and because of this the patient was then taken emergently to the operating room for debridement to rule out a necrotizing soft tissue infection for Fournier's gangrene. The risks and benefits were discussed with the patient and with the significant other in detail including the possibility of death.

The patient does not remember the details of fall, but patient told daughter that she tripped and fell at home into a plate of glass. She hit the right side of her forehead and hit her right elbow and hip. No post ictal state, no incontinece of bowel or bladder.  She also denies lightheadedness, vision changes, chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath, tongue biting, dizziness, nausea and vomiting.  This event happened at approximately 10pm last night and she initially was taken to [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital where by report a head CT, c-spine films, CXR were negative.  A hip CT was notable for a fracture of the superior ramus and acetabulum. She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for management of her hip fracture.  She was initially on the medicine service but was stable and was transferred to orthopedics for definitive operative management.  Pre-operatively she was briefly hypotensive in the setting of narcotics for pain, and responded well to IVF and 3 units PRBCs.  She underwent right acetabular ORIF on [**2140-6-19**] and [**2140-6-22**]. Post-operatively, her course was complicated by UTI s/p cipro, and CHF.  She required a left CVL for access which was subsequently removed and was replaced by a left sided PICC line.

The patient presented to an outside hospital with rectal bleeding and chest pain on [**8-25**].  Baseline hematocrit is approximately 35%.  Cardiac enzymes were negative.  Rectal bleeding was stopped.  She was treated with aspirin, iron and Metamucil.  Colonoscopy done previously on [**2152-8-21**] showed diverticulosis and internal hemorrhoids. Diagnostic catheterization done on [**8-25**] at outside hospital showed three vessel coronary artery disease.  The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for intervention.  In the catheterization laboratory the patient had an episode of chest pain, which was relieved with sublingual nitroglycerin with evidence of ST depressions on her electrocardiogram.  Angiography showed diffuse disease of the right coronary artery and total occlusion of the mid right coronary artery and 90% stenosis of the left anterior descending coronary artery and discreet lesions in the obtuse marginal one.  Her distal left anterior descending coronary artery demonstrated TIMI three flow without significant obstructive disease.  Three overlapping stents were placed in the mid left anterior descending coronary artery with no residual stenosis.  Obtuse marginal one had one stent placed with no residual stenosis and the right coronary artery lesion had evidence of collaterals, therefore no stent was placed.  In the Coronary Care Unit the patient was somewhat somnolent, admitted to chest pain for the past three weeks prior to admission relieved with sublingual nitroglycerin. On her recent admission to the outside hospital for bleeding she states she was washing dishes and noted a pool of bright red blood on the floor.

She is SOB after walking 40 feet, climbing one flight of stairs and carrying in empty trash cans from the curb, none of these activities bothered her over the summer. She denies chest pain and resting SOB. She has mild swelling in the ankles d/t a broken ankle a long time ago. Cardiac catheterization on [**10-31**] confirmed severe AS with mean gradient of 32 mmHg and [**Location (un) 109**] of 0.73 cm2. Selective coronary angiography showed a right dominant system. There was no true left main coronary artery as the left coronary ostium only supplied the left anterior descending artery. The left anterior descending artery had angiographic evidence of a 40% stenosis in the proximal vessel. The left circumflex artery arose from a separate ostium at the right aortic valve cusp. This ostium is separate from the RCA ostium, but connectsvertically to the ostium of the RCA. The left circumflex artery does not have angiographic evidence of coronary artery disease in the proximal segment. There is angiographic evidence of 40-50% in-stent restenosis in the mid-LCX. The right coronary artery had a proximal [**Doctor Last Name 45655**] crook with a 40% stenosis. There was no evidence of significant flow limiting stenosis in the mid or distal RCA.

Frequent hospitalization for trach exchanges and stent placements. Admitted initially to thoracix surgery service with respiratory failure. Last month, the patient was admitted for worsening respiratory distress and gastrointestinal bleeding (diverticulosis and hemrrhoids). During that admission, bronchoscopy was performed, she was found to have severe tracheobronchomalacia for which she underwent a Y silicone stent placement. In addition, she had some component of tracheal stenosis, and her trach was changed to a Portex #7, which was telescoped through the Y-stent. She was also diagnosed with pneumonia based on peak WBC 23, right perihilar and left retrocardiac infiltrates and positive sputum cultures. Cultures grew acinetobacter and stenotrophomonas for which she received a 14 day course of Bactrim and Unasyn. She recovered and was transfered to rehab. . She presented to pulmonary clinic on [**9-11**] for routine follow up appointment, and was found to be in respiratory distress, tachypneic, hypoxic to 80%.

BAL grew acinetobacter sensitive to unasyn. She was started back on bactrim/unasyn She was planned for OR removal of stent in setting of stenosis but this was deferred due to pt's persistently high Fi02 requirement. CTA was performed which showed no PE but multifocal PNA, unclear if this is resolving infection from recent PNA or new process.

He was diagnosed with PMR and started on prednisone with improvement in his symptoms. During the preceding six months, he reported a history of shoulder, neck and quadriceps pain as well as fatigue, weakness and poor appetite. He reported periodic fevers, drenching night sweats and a 25-pound weight loss also over the same six months. With initiation of his prednisone at 20 mg daily, he noted marked improvement of both his musculoskeletal and constitutional symptoms. He then presented to the emergency room on [**2197-7-17**] with palpitations and dizziness and was found to be in atrial fibrillation. He had a history of PAF in the past. He was febrile to 101.6 with a heart rate of 126. CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis on [**2197-7-19**] showed multiple low-attenuation lesions within the liver, spleen, and kidneys. On [**2197-7-20**], MRI of the abdomen showed hypovascular masses in both kidneys and spleen of various sizes consistent with lymphoma. A CT-guided biopsy of the spleen on [**2197-7-21**] was nondiagnostic. Mr. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] bone marrow aspirate and biopsy on [**2197-7-26**], which showed extensive necrosis with focal involvement by high-grade B-cell lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell type. FISH translocation was notable for c-Myc and Bcl-2 indicating a \\\"double hit\\\" lymphoma characterized by a Burkitt's-like lymphoma. He then began chemotherapy. . TREATMENT HISTORY: -- Initiated treatment with Dose-adjusted [**Hospital1 **] chemotherapy on  [**2197-7-29**] with two doses of Rituxan on [**2197-8-2**] and [**2197-8-3**]. Follow up CT imaging on [**2197-8-5**] showed stable lymphomatous lesions in the kidney, spleen, and abdominal nodes.  -- Rituxan 500 mg given on [**2197-8-10**] with a fever that evening  and admission for neutropenia. During admission, noted for atrial fibrillation with RVR and was started on digoxin at 0.125  mg daily along with metoprolol 200 mg daily. -- Readmitted on [**2197-8-18**] for his second cycle of [**Hospital1 **] chemotherapy, which was delayed for two days due to hypotension  and cough. A CT of the chest showed bilateral lower lobe opacities, right greater than left, concerning for infection and he was treated with a course of Levaquin. -- On [**2197-8-30**], received Rituxan at 375 mg/m2. -- Follow up PET scan on [**2197-9-6**] showed no evidence for lymphoma but was notable for multiple peripheral base pulmonary  opacities with rims of soft tissue density and relative central  lucencies most of which were new. He [**Year (4 digits) 1834**] CT of the chest for further evaluation, which showed multiple filling defects within the segmental and subsegmental branches of the right lower lobe arteries compatible with pulmonary emboli. -- Admitted on [**2197-9-7**] for initiation of anticoagulation with  fondaparinux and began third cycle of treatment with [**Hospital1 **] on [**2197-9-8**](dose level 2). -- Received Rituxan 375 mg/m2 on [**2197-9-25**]. -- Admitted on [**2197-9-29**] for fourth cycle of treatment with [**Hospital1 **](dose level 3). -- Received Rituxan 375 mg/m2 on [**2197-10-17**]. -- Admitted on [**2197-10-20**] for fifth cycle of treatment with [**Hospital1 **](dose level 3 with Adriamycin at dose level 2. Received Rituxan on [**2197-11-7**]. -- FDG tumor imaging on [**2197-10-19**] showed no evidence for lymphoma with slight interval decrease in size in bilateral pulmonary infarcts. Focal uptake in the posterior left kidney appears parenchymal, but may be within the collecting system and  projecting over the kidney due to misregistration. Focal FDG uptake in the left ischial tuberosity, without corresponding lytic or sclerotic lesion. Bone marrow biopsy showed no evidence  for lymphoma and no cytogenetic abnormalities, particularly no c-Myc or Bcl2 translocation. Note was made of hypercellular marrow with maturing trilineage hematopoiesis. -- Admitted on [**2197-11-16**] with sudden onset of a dark cover in the lower half of the visual field in his right eye, which lasted 10-15 minutes, then self-resolved. He was evaluated by Neurology and Ophthalmology. TEE revealed thrombus at the tip of his right atrial catheter, with no PFO. Ophthalmology work up was negative and the episode was attributed to possible TIA. Discharged on [**2197-11-18**] to continue his fondaparinux. -- Admitted on [**2197-11-23**] for high dose Cytoxan for stem cell mobilization. -- Attempted stem cell collections with yield ~ 0.5 CD 34 cels after 4 collections with slow recovery of counts. Collections stopped. -- Repeat PET imaging on [**2197-12-19**] showed new focal mild FDG-avidities in the mediastinal region. Interval worsening of FDG-avidity in the soft tissue immediately medial to the left acetabulum. Persistent FDG-avidity in the left ischial tuberosity, without CT correlate. -- Repeat bone marrow biopsy on [**2197-12-20**] showed no evidence for lymphoma with some dyspoiesis noted. No cytogenetic abnormalities, specifically no evidence for MDS. -- Initiated 4 weeks of Rituxan on [**2197-12-26**]. -- Noted slight increase in LDH to ~ 260. Repeat CT of the torso on [**2198-1-3**] showed left pelvic soft tissue and expansion of the left piriformis muscle corresponding to the regions of FDG avidity for [**2197-12-19**] scan. Small internal mammary and left  juxtaclavicular lymph nodes corresponding to foci of FDG avidity. Decreased size of lymphomatous renal lesions compared to [**2197-7-6**] with stable small retroperitoneal lymph nodes. Continued evolution of pulmonary infarcts. No definite bony lesions, though there is slightly lucency in the left acetabulum in a region of FDG avidity. . Other Past Medical History: s/p RLL lobectomy in [**2198-2-6**] secondary to PNA #. PAF diagnosed in [**2180**] with now chronic atrial fibrillation in the past several months. He had no history of treatment with anti-arrhythmia or anticoagulation prior to his admission in [**8-/2197**], currently receiving treatment with metoprolol and digoxin. #.

On [**4-24**], the patient was extubated, and successfully and verbally following commands. Platelet count was low at 81, and she was transfused with platelets. Patient was evaluated by cardiology for her Afib. They recommended rate control, a surface echocardiogram, keeping her electrolytes within normal limits, keeping her heart rate in the 60 range.  EEG was done, which just showed encephalopathy. The patient had repeat head CT which was stable.  On [**2199-4-25**], she was transferred to the step-down unit. She remained awake, alert, following commands, and moving all extremities. On [**2199-4-26**], the patient had episode of nonsustained V-tach. Patient ruled out for a MI. Cardiology was notified. She continued to have some episodes of respiratory distress requiring some Lasix for CHF and also increasing heart rate with episodes of rapid Afib.  Cardiology was reconsulted, and her Lopressor was increased. She was loaded with digoxin. She was seen by cardiology for possible cardioversion if rate control was not obtained. She remained neurologically opening her eyes briefly, following commands intermittently, verbalizing her name. Patient was seen by speech and swallow for possible PEG, although patient did not respond well to swallow testing. They did feel that with a couple of more days, before mental status improves, she may be able to generate a swallow without aspiration. Currently, she is at high aspiration risk and requires a feeding tube in place.  Her vital signs have remained stable. She has been afebrile. She did have an induced sputum sent on [**2199-4-24**] that showed gram-negative rods. Although she has an allergy to penicillin, sensitivities on the sputum were performed.

However, on the day of her most recent cystoscopy on [**3-5**] at [**Hospital1 69**], she experienced a tachycardia, which was terminated after she received intravenous Lopressor. The same tachycardia occurred on [**3-9**] for which she presented to [**Hospital6 17032**] Emergency Room, where the tachycardia was terminated with intravenous adenosine. The tracings of the tachycardia were reviewed by her Electrophysiologist, Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) 1911**], and thought be a narrow complex tachycardia at 150 beats/minute with an RP interval of 100-120 msec. However, immediately post adenosine, there was evidence of sinus rhythm with a fully pre-excited QRS complex consistent with a left lateral bypass tract. Since the Emergency Room visit, she has been on low-dose atenolol without further recurrences of the arrhythmia.

His PCO2 is normally in the 60s (per OMR) but were worse on admission (103). Per caretaker, the patient has been having steadily increasing O2 requirements over the last 6 weeks and has not been able to perform his usual activities. He is normally on 2L Nasal O2 at home with O2 sats 98-100%. During the week before admission, he required 4L O2 to keep O2 sats above 90%. He was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 **] for multifocal PNA in [**6-19**]. . Per caretaker, the patient has been complaining of cough over the last week. The patient is mostly non-verbal. He can utter short phrases, but is NOT TO BE TAKEN at face value, i.e., when offered food, he may say he is not hungry even though he has not eaten that day. He is able to vocalize pain and discomfort with pointing. He is ambulatory (with assistance) at baseline and is normally incontinent of urine and stool. .

CTA showed worsening volume loss of right lung and left-sided pulmonary edema with possible multifocal infection. He was given ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and vancomycin. He was admitted directly to the ICU for further management. In the ICU, he had episodes of desaturation to the mid-50s; these improved rapidly with face mask and nebulizer treatment. He did not require intubation. His antibiotics were changed to levofloxacin and Unasyn for treatment of pneumonia. Repeat ABGs showed improvement in pC02 and p02, and he was transferred to the floor for further management. He was then transferred to the floor. . On the floor this morning at approximately 4:30 am, he was found to be acutely agitated, he had removed his oxygen and was desaturating into the teens - he became cyanotic and unresponsive. A gas shortly after this revealed a pco2 of 109 - up from his baseline of pCo2 of 60. On replacing his oxygen by face mask (100%), he recovered his sats, his color, and his responsiveness. He is transferred to the MICU for continual O2 monitoring. . PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Mitochondrial enzyme deficiency causing mental and developmental retardation.

The patient was admitted to [**Hospital **] Hospital on [**5-4**] requesting detoxification as he started using IV drugs again.  He had not been compliant with his medications, including his coumadin.  He was found to have a subclavian DVT and a left brachial arterial aneurysm, which was thought to be secondary to injection of IV drugs.  Vascular evaluated the patient and recommended the patient be fully sober before any attempt at aneurysm repair. He was placed on a heparin gtt and transitioned to coumadin. He had an elevated WBC there and was febrile so he was started in azithromycin with improvement in both.  However, on [**5-8**], he became agitated and left the hospital AMA.  He returned to the ED on [**5-9**] and reported chest pain radiating to the left arm, headache, photophobia (no rigidity) and shortness of breath.  He reported using cocaine since his discharge and denied use of EtOH. . While there, he was found to be febrile with increasing shortness of breath.

Later on during the hospitalization, he was found to have a dense aphasia and left hemiplegia.  Neurology was consulted and felt this could be secondary to meningitis vs embolic events.  CT scan demonstrated poor definition of perimesencephalic cisterns without asymmetry which was concerning for some increased intracranial pressure. There was evidence of treated AVM with no other signs of acute or evolving territorial infarct.  Patient was started on a heparin gtt for presumed embolic event. . Given the concern for meningitis, he was also treated with vancomycin, ceftriaxone and gentamycin.  His mental status remained altered.  In addition, his respiratory status worsened requiring intubation on evening [**5-16**].  CXR did not reveal a clear consolidation and he had elevated A-a gradient so he underwent a CTA which did not reveal a PE.   His mental status did not improve and his respiratory status worsened.

Patient was recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] on [**9-20**] after undergoing stent placement in the left mainstem bronchus and Y stent placement in the trachea. . Patient initially presented to OSH in respiratory distress and was found to have an anterior mediastinal mass on CXR, confirmed by CT. Patient continued to desat from 80s to low 50s and was eventually intubated. Patient was transfered to [**Hospital1 2177**] on [**2171-7-22**] per request of family. According to family, patient was in his usual state of health until he started to have generalized symptoms 6 months prior to presentation to OSH including sore throat, cough, and respiratory symptoms. Patient had been treated for 2 weeks for bronchitis without resolution. . At [**Hospital1 2177**], patient was intially intubated with double lumen ETT for acute respiratory distress. Patient had multiple episodes of desaturation requiring intervention with bronchoscopy for better ETT positioning. On bronchoscopy, the anterior mass was noticed to cause tracheal narrowing and obstruction of the mainstem bronchi bilaterally. Patient's double lumen ETT was changed to a single lumen on [**7-26**] for better ventilation. Course complicated by bilateral pneumothoraces requiring bilateral chest tube placement which were d/c'ed on [**8-24**] and [**8-25**]. Patient was extubated on [**8-23**] but reintubation on [**8-30**] due to hypercarbic respiratory failure. He was transferred at this time to [**Hospital1 18**] for Y stent placement and then transferred back to [**Hospital1 2177**]. He was extubated on [**9-21**] and initially did well but could not adequately handle the secretions so he was taken to the OR on [**9-27**] for tracheostomy by ENT. The procedure was technically difficult since the Y stent was too high. He was reintubated (nasotracheal tube) in OR with bronchoscopy to remove mucous plugging in right middle and lower lobes. . He underwent an ultrasound guided biopsy of his anterior mediastinal mass on [**7-23**]. Given elevated AFP (4093 on [**7-23**]) and biopsy of undifferentiated carcinoma, patient was treated for germ cell tumor with neoadjuvant cisplatin and etoposide from [**Date range (1) 73635**]. Patient prophylaxed for TLS with alopurinol, dexamethasone, and IV fluids. Chemotherapy complicated by pancytopenia and neutropenic fever, requiring PRBC transfusions on Neupogen. Cycle 2 of chemotherapy delayed due to development of Pseudomonas sepsis and ARF. However, with stabilization, patient underwent cycle 2 of carboplatinum and etoposide on [**8-4**]. At the time of transfer, patient is reportedly at his chemo-induced neutropenic nadir. However, Hct and platelets have been stable. . From an ID perspective, following cycle 1 of chemotherapy, patient was diagnosed with a VAP on [**7-28**] and was started on vancomycin and cefepime. Both were continued with the addition of fluconazole for neutropenic precautions following chemotherapy. Cefepime was changed to Zosyn when patient's sputum culture was (+) for Achromobacter on [**8-7**]. Patient then developed an abscess in his R groin at the site of a prior line which was I&Ded by surgery on [**8-16**] and was also the source of the above mentioned MDR pseudomonas sepsis. Patient had pseudomonas in blood, urine, and R groin abscess cultures. He completed a 15 day course of gentamicin and cefepime, despite nephrotoxicity as pseudomonas in wound culture was only sensitive to Gentamicin. Patient was then started on Vancomycin due to MRSA from R quinton tip culture. Also started on Amikacin for Pseudomonas in sputum and urine. Diarrhea started on [**8-17**]. C diff was negative x 3 and was thought to be secondary to chemotherapy. He was placed on empiric Flagyl at this time. A CT scan was obtained on [**9-15**] showing ileocecal thickening and ? typhlitis (necrotizing enterocolitis) as well as some ? intusseception fo ascending colon, although there was no evidence of obstruction. Patient then had temp spike through above broad antibiotic coverage and empiric caspofungin started on [**9-15**]. With persisting fevers patient was continued on Cefepime, Amikacin, for pseudomonas in sputum and urine. . [**Hospital **] hospital course was also complicated by ARF thought to be secondary to pseudomonas sepsis and hypotension on [**8-8**]. Patient developed poor UOP and lasix gtt started with poor response. Patient eventually required CVVH for volume overload on [**8-11**] with 6L removal, and on [**8-15**] with 4L removal. R Quinton placed in R IJ and patient was started on HD on [**8-17**]. Quinton eventually clotted on [**8-25**] and he recent emergent dialysis through a newly placed left femoral line. He then went to IR for possible L quinton placement for HD, but was discovered to have bilat DVTs in IJs which prevented placement. He eventually responded to 140 mg IV lasix with good UOP on [**8-29**] and the L femoral line was d/c'ed to prevent further infection. ARF eventually resolved with normal Cr and good UOP.\\n\\nMEDICAL HISTORY: # Germ cell tumor in mediastinum - s/p 2 rounds of chemotherapy # pancytopenia [**3-15**] chemotherapy\\n\\nMEDICATION ON ADMISSION: Ipratropium Bromide MDI 4 PUFF IH QID Acetaminophen 650 mg PO Q6H:PRN Lansoprazole Oral Disintegrating Tab 30 mg PO DAILY Albuterol 10 PUFF IH Q4H Lorazepam 1-3 mg IV Q1H:PRN anxiety Albuterol 10 PUFF IH Q2H:PRN Metoprolol 12.5 mg PO TID Amikacin 1100 mg IV Q36H Methadone HCl 20mg PO Q8H CefePIME 2gm IV Q8H Miconazole Powder 2% 1 Appl TP TID Diazepam 10mg PO BID Nephrocaps 1 CAP PO DAILY Fentanyl Citrate 25-100 mcg/hr IV DRIP INFUSION Nystatin Oral Suspension 5 ml PO QID Haloperidol 5 mg IM Q4H:PRN agitation Olanzapine 5 mg PO DAILY Promethazine HCl 6.25 mg IV Q6H:PRN Insulin SC Sliding Scale Vancomycin 1.25gm IV Q 12H .

With relapse of her myeloma, she received thalidomide from [**Month (only) **] to [**2143-10-25**]. 2. Nonmyeloablative allogeneic stem cell transplant from a sibling donor in 11/[**2143**]. 3. Noted for recurrent disease in the summer of [**2145**] and received a donor lymphocyte infusion in [**8-/2145**] with relatively a stable disease after this. 4. Noted for slow progression of her disease in the fall of [**2150**] and status post a second donor lymphocyte infusion on [**2151-2-5**] given at a dose of one x10 to the seventh T-cell/kg. 5. Admitted on [**2151-9-13**] due to worsening renal insufficiency with creatinine of 3.4 and new lung mass causing right lower lobe collapse. The lung mass was biopsied and thought consistent with amyloid. 6. Following [**Year (4 digits) **], she was started on thalidomide for a short period of time, but was readmitted on [**2151-9-28**] due to left lower edema and new DVTs. 7. Received Cytoxan [**2151-9-30**] with Decadron 20mg X 4 days with no change in disease. 8. Received Velcade 1.3mg/m2 D1 and D4, but then admitted due to worsening lower extremity edema and increased creatinine. 9. Received Cycle 1 Velcade/Cytoxan/Decadron on [**2151-10-22**]. Cycle 2 started on [**2151-11-12**]. Cycle 3 on [**2151-12-3**] with D11 Velcade held. C 4 started on [**2151-12-24**] but admitted following morning due to dyspnea. C5 started on [**2152-1-31**] with D8 Cytoxan held and D11 Velcade held due to low counts. Also on dialysis for renal failure. 10. Thalidomide to start on [**2152-2-18**]. Coumadin is anticoagulation. 11. Another admission on [**2152-3-9**] due to increasing shortness of breath and worsening/recurrent pneumothoraces on the left side. She underwent pleurodesis and although had a reaction to the talc procedure, she was discharged home after only about a one-week stay in the hospital. She resumed her thalidomide at 50 mg daily, and she has slowly increased this to 150 mg daily as of [**2152-4-17**]. She was restarted on Coumadin which is being adjusted  to keep INR at 2-3. 13.

As you recall, he is a 30-year-old man with a history of ruptured hepatic adenomas that turned out to [**Hospital1 **] some hepatocellular carcinoma.  He is scheduled for reexcision of two adenomas that we intentionally left behind at his prior incision.  He reports he has actually been feeling quite well and that his weight has been stable.  He has had no problems with the incision itself.  He denies any nausea, vomiting, fevers, chills, chest pain, or shortness of breath.  He is moving his bowels regularly.  Medications were reviewed today and include cholestyramine, which he says he has not actually started taking as well as his scopolamine patch for his preop nausea control.  On examination today, his temperature is 98.4, heart rate 83, blood pressure 125/85.  His weight is 87.8 kilos.  He is anicteric and in no acute distress.  His lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.  His heart is regular.  His abdomen is soft and nondistended.  His incision has healed nicely without evidence of hernia.  He has no peripheral edema.  Laboratory studies from today are notable for white count of 5, hematocrit 46, and platelets of 178,000.  His INR is 1.0.  His renal function panel is entirely within normal limits with a creatinine of 0.9.  His liver function tests remain mildly elevated with an ALT of 161, AST 116, alkaline phosphatase 169, and total bilirubin of 0.6.  In summary, Mr. [**Known lastname 1637**] is a 30-year-old man with multiple hepatic adenomas, likely due to steroid ingestion.  He is scheduled for reexcision of a segment IV adenoma as well as a segment II/III adenoma.  We are hopeful that these do not [**Hospital1 **] any cancer, although as he was found to have carcinoma in his prior specimens, we feel strongly that these should be removed. He knows that there are still remaining several small adenomas, but we are hopeful that as he is off steroids, these may regress. Alternatively, if he does [**Hospital1 **] more cancer, we will have to talk about the potential need for liver transplantation.  We did not discuss this in detail, but he knows that this is a possibility going forward.\\n\\nMEDICAL HISTORY: ARF s/p ingestion of nautral diuretic product\\n\\nMEDICATION ON ADMISSION: None\\n\\nALLERGIES: Dilaudid\\n\\nPHYSICAL EXAM: Pre-Op examination His temperature is 98.4, heart rate 83, blood pressure 125/85.

The patient had a prolonged and complicated hospital course.  He failed extubation on POD 2 and multiple times thereafter. . He had persistent leukocytosis, fevers, and diarrhea during hospitalization and was empirically treated for C. Diff with a 10-day course of vancomycin & flagyl (despite 7 negative C. Diff toxin tests). . His thoracotomy wound developed erythema and blistering and he had an incision & drainage of [**2142-3-21**] (fluid culture returned without growth).  He becam septic on [**2142-4-8**] and, in addition to persisent leukocytosis & fevers, he also became hypotensive and required pressors.  He was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics per ID recommendations. He was found to have a graft infection (noted on CT) requiring IR drainage on [**2142-4-8**]. All OR swabs were without growth. . The patient had a tracheostomy & PEG tube placed on [**2142-4-1**] for multile failed attempts at extubation. . Ultimately, his sputum was showed enterobacter; the patient was started on meropenem.  He was transferred to [**Hospital1 49145**] on [**2142-4-16**] on meropenem (course to end on [**2142-4-22**]). . On [**2142-4-24**], the patient presented to the [**Hospital3 **] from NESH with hypoxic respiratory failure with hypotension & fever to 101.3.  At that time, according to the OSH notes, he was still on meropenem and this was initially continued. In he ED he was found to have a PNA which was ultimately determined to be due to Enterobacter resistant to all tested antibiotics except tigecycline.  He initially required ventilatory support, but transitioned to trach mask on [**2142-4-30**].  He has since been stable from a hemodynamic & respiratory standpoint. . A CT chest with contrast performed (& read) at OSH demonstrated a 7 x 3.4 x 1.7 cm loculated pleural fluid collection at the lateral posterior aspect of the L lung base. . Serial chest x-rays during his admission at [**Hospital3 **] demonstrated development of a a R lower lobe PNA. . The patient has had an intermittent leukocytosis with bandemia at the [**Hospital3 **]. A tagged WBC scan was performed on [**4-30**] in an attempt to identify an infectious source.  The scan demonstrated increased update in the L chest adjacent to the aortic arch which was suspicious for a periarotic infection.  According to notes, he has been afebrile for several days but developed WBC 12.3 with 13% bands [**Last Name (un) **].    As such, the patient is being transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation and treatment. .

       "    \"text_a\": \"CHIEF COMPLAINT: \\n\\nPRESENT ILLNESS: Short gut syndrome, chronically occluded superior vena cava, right brachiocephalic vein and right jugular vein, occlusion of the inferior vena cava and both common iliac veins, TPN dependent.  polyposis, she had resection of her colon at age 20 and now has a high output ileostomy.  She is dependent on TPN although she can take small amounts of oral food.  Over the years, she has chronically occluded both internal jugular veins, both subclavian veins and the upper segment of the superior vena cava.  She came in [**2138-7-26**], to our attention when she had developed Staphylococcus aureus sepsis At this time, we removed a tunneled femoral catheter which had been tunneled from the right groin into the left upper chest and placed temporary access.  After clearing of the infection, we were attempting to recanalize the occluded central veins but were unsuccessful, even with a sharp recanalization technique.  On [**2138-12-9**], I then decided to place a new tunneled right femoral 7French double lumen Hickman catheter with tip at the level of L1 and the exit site over the lateral thigh.  The patient came to see on [**2139-9-7**], in clinic with the chief complaint of line dysfunction.  She had noticed some sluggishness of return during TPN infusions and then had stopped TPN and only placed hydration.  She brought a venogram from [**2139-8-26**], which demonstrated that the tip of the catheter had pulled back into the distal inferior vena cava. There was some high grade narrowing in both common iliac veins which were still patent at this time.  The inferior vena cava was not filled and there were paralumbar collaterals.  On [**2139-9-11**], she was admitted to St. [**Hospital 107**] Medical Center in [**Hospital1 189**], [**State 350**] for line sepsis, generalized weakness, near syncope and low grade fever.  She came to the [**Hospital1 69**] on [**2139-9-15**].  She presented in a severely debilitated status.  Her blood pressure was 96/54, with a pulse rate of 123, temperature 100, and oxygen saturation 99%.  The catheter over the right thigh had pulled back with the calf being outside of the skin.  There was some swelling and induration over the right thigh extending to the level of the knee which was suggestive of deep venous thrombosis but additional superinfection and cellulitis could not be ruled out.   The lungs were clear. The abdomen was soft.  There was an intact left lower quadrant ileostomy.  The heart rate was regular and considering the rate, murmurs could not be elicited.  To assess her semi-obtunded status, blood was drawn which revealed a severe hypomagnesemia with a level of 0.7 and a hematocrit of 26.6.  She received an infusion of Magnesium. Because of an antibody to the blood, blood was ordered but couldn't be transfused before the start of the procedure. To reduce further risks of sepsis due to the line, we proceeded with recanalization of the inferior vena cava.  Because of the patient's low pain threshold, all procedures had to be performed under MAC anesthesia.  I removed the tunneled right femoral line and replaced it with a 7French bright tip sheath.  I also gained access through the left femoral vein. It was possible to recanalize both iliac veins and the chronically occluded inferior vena cava.  Infusion catheters were placed and TPA was infused for the remainder of the day and of the night.  On [**2139-9-16**], the patient returned to the angiography suite in the morning.  Some interval lysis had occurred.  The TPA infusion was continued until the afternoon.  In the meantime, she had been transfused with two units of packed red blood cells and her hematocrit had reached 30.0.  In the afternoon, I was able to dilate the occluded inferior vena cava and place kissing stents in the chronic occlusion channels of the inferior vena cava.  Stents were also extended into both common iliac veins and the adjacent segments of the external iliac veins.  The patient was heparinized overnight.  The next morning a follow-up was done which demonstrated that the left sided system was still open.  On the right side, a separation between the caval and the iliac stent had occurred and the inferior stent had moved slightly laterally.  The main goal for this day's procedure was to give the patient also a superior vena cava access since it became clear that she would be having recurrent infections in the long run. The main treatment goal was to provide for the future three access sites: one for a tunneled line, one for a temporary line should the permanent one become infected and needs pulling, and a 3rd for a new tunneled line, considering this patient is life- long tpn. She was controlled with Vancomycin.  Her levels on the one gram per day regimen was what she came from the outside revealed a Vancomycin random level of 40. With input from infectious diseases consult over the next days, appropriate Vancomycin regimen was obtained.  On [**2139-9-17**], I then undertook sharp recanalization of the superior vena cava through a right internal jugular approach by placing a snare into the superior vena cava as a target.  It was possible to recanalize the internal jugular, brachiocephalic, and superior vena cava with stents and  place a temporary double lumen catheter.  In the same session, I also repaired the separated caval stent by placing of an additional briding stent. By the next morning, the patient remained heparinized.  She had some oozing around the right neck exit site.  I had removed the femoral access on the evening before to reduce the overall risk of infection.  We had obtained cultures from the tip of the previously indwelling tunneled catheter and blood cultures were obtained.  There was no growth to date. A regimen with one gram Vancomycin every eighteen hours was then achieved with appropriate trough levels.  Ultimately, the right internal jugular line was exchanged for a tunneled 7French double lumen Angiodynamics catheter of 57 centimeter length.  The tip was placed into the superior vena cava.  In the following course, the patient had only low grade temperature to 100, however, no spikes.  She was transferred to the [**Hospital1 **] from the Intensive Care Unit on [**2139-9-22**].  On [**2139-9-22**], she still had some swelling of her neck and both arms which may have been related to fluid therapy.  An ultrasound on [**2139-9-13**], demonstrated that the internal jugular vein and superior vena cava were patent compatible with a successful recanalization.  On [**2139-9-23**], the swelling had been much reduced so that now there also was a satisfying clinic result, and on [**9-24**] facies and arms were normal.  We had attempted to Coumadinize her since she had been on Coumadin on the outside.  However, because of the unreliable gastrointestinal absorption, we decided to add instead greater amounts of Heparin to her TPN and her daily infusion regimen.  Of note, her hematocrit drifted again down to 23.0% on [**2139-9-22**].  This included a blood loss of about 250 cc for all the surgical interventions.  We therefore transfused her again with two units of packed red blood cells.  From an infectious disease point, she never expressed open sepsis.  We will keep her on Vancomycin until [**2139-9-24**].  She developed an oral herpes which was treated for five days with Acyclovir.  The TPN is to be reinstituted with a nightly infusion. With hematology consult we recommend to add folate and B12. B12 may not be stable in TPN, so she may need addional injections.  We drew folate and B12 levels today. results are pending. adapted the composition to address the recurrent. Heparin in the TPN infusion bag should be increased to 8000 U per day. The daily 1 L infusion of  D5-/2NS should be supplemented with 5000 U heparin to be infused over the day. Additional fluid should not contain heparin if need for hydration in presence of a high out put ileostomy.  We also obtained hematology consultation to address the issue of recurrent bouts of anemia which the patient also had at home. This resulted in the B12 and folate additon recommendation. We also drew today Ferritin, folate, B12 and reticulocyte counts. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3060**] will follow up with outpatient consult. Recommend also bone density study because of prior hysterectomy and heparin use as well as genetic cousneling because of [**Doctor First Name **] familial inbcidence of cancer to assess for Li-Frameni BRCA. On discharge, the patient is stable.  She has no signs of acute infection.\\n\\nMEDICAL HISTORY: \\n\\nMEDICATION ON ADMISSION: \\n\\nALLERGIES: \\n\\nPHYSICAL EXAM: \\n\\nFAMILY HISTORY: \\n\\nSOCIAL HISTORY: \",\n",

       "    \"text_a\": \"CHIEF COMPLAINT: unwitnessed fall at home/[**Hospital3 **] facility, rapid heart rate\\n\\nPRESENT ILLNESS: Mrs. [**Known lastname 10528**] is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old female with PMH significant for atrial fibrillation,HTN, breast cancer (s/p mastectomy [**2049**]), hypothyroidism, who was originally admitted on [**11-28**] following an unwitnessed fall at home. Prior to ED arrival the patient had been evaluated by her PCP at her [**Hospital3 **] facility for left shoulder pain which was felt to be due to an effusion. According to patient she went into her bathroom, remembers sitting on the toilet, then she fell to the floor. She did not recall feeling lightheaded or dizzy. She denied any palpitations, chest pain, or acute onset of shortness of breath. She did not believe that she lost consciousness and could recall details of her entire fall. Patient believes she was on the floor for a few hours because she found it very difficult to pull herself up. She reported that she thought she may have hit her head and left shoulder. . In the ED her initial vitals were T 98F, HR 156, BP 160/80, RR 22, and O2 sat 95% on RA. She was found to be in rapid atrial fibrillation to the 150's and was started on a diltiazem drip with initial good effect. She received a dose of ciprofloxacin for a positive UA in the setting of a leukocytosis to 19. CT of the head and neck were negative for any fractures, and no intracranial bleeds were noted. Bilateral shoulder x-rays were negative for fractures or dislocations. . At time of arrival to the medical floor patient's rate was down to the 60's-70's. She denied any palpitations, CP or SOB. Her main complaint was left sided shoulder pain, which had been chronic for some time. She denied any recent illnesses including URI symptoms, urinary symptoms, diarrhea, nausea or vomiting. She reported poor appetite for a few days. . . On the medical floor, she subsequently had multiple triggers for atrial fibrillation with RVR. Blood cultures from admission grew GPC so she was started on Vancomycin on [**11-29**]. Due to complaints of left shoulder pain, she then underwent arthrocentesis of the left shoulder. Culture of the joint fluid ultimately yielded MSSA, as did multiple blood cultures ([**2-24**] from [**11-28**], [**12-29**] from [**11-29**], and [**12-25**] from [**11-30**]). She was seen by the cardiology service who recommended changing her from diltiazem for metoprolol. . Of note, her fluid balance remained positive throughout the beginning of her hospital course, and her weight increased from 68->73kg. Due to concern over ARF, she received IVFs and she then developed fluid overload, pulmonary edema and hypoxia which required transfer to the MICU for stabilization. Her MICU course was complicated by AFib/Flutter with RVR occasionally requiring IV nodal agents. She was aggressively diuresed in the MICU with IV furosemide and at time of transfer, her shortness of breath had abated and her oxygen saturation level was much improved to 96% on 5L NC. . Once she stabilized she was transferred to [**Hospital1 1516**]/Cardiology service for ongoing management and continued on Diltiazem drip for rate control. At time she transferred out of MICU, she was receiving Diltiazem Extended-Release 300 mg PO daily and Metoprolol Tartrate 25 mg PO TID, with additional IV agents as needed. The patient's bacteremia was felt to be related to an underlying endocarditis. Echocardiogram on [**2102-11-30**] showed EF of 70%, mild AS, and at least moderate 2+ mitral regurgitation. No comparisons existed in our system. Patient was also complaining of diffuse generalized abdominal pain that had been present for 2 days near the end of her MICU course prior to transfer to cardiology service. The patient had not had a bowel movement in about 4 days. Surgical service was called due to preliminary read on abdominal CT which showed SBO and  incarcerated right inguinal hernia which was reported to be at transition point near terminal ileum. Surgery consult called and evaluation on the floor found that hernia was reducible. Primary team placed NGT for ease of her abdominal pain and distension from SBO/ileus. Surgical options were limited due to multiple co-morbidities, especially her bacteremia, suspected endocarditis, unstable atrial fibrillation with RVR and her ongoing dyspneic episodes. This prompted multiple discussions with patient and family surrounding goals of care during the last days of her hospital course. The palliative care service had been following the case and had multiple patient/family meetings. She pulled her NGT out on two occasions and her mentation was less clear toward the end of her hospital course. She was given low doses of morphine, Tylenol, and anti-emetics for SBO-related abdominal pain control. Ultimately, the patient's family (HCP/son) asked for no additional invasive measures, especially surgery. Code status was changed to DNR/DNI, and she was soon made comfort measures only per family's wishes. Sadly, she passed away soon thereafter on the morning of [**2102-12-8**].\\n\\nMEDICAL HISTORY: -Breast Cancer, s/p L mastectomy in [**2049**] -Atrial Fibrillation, rate controlled on metoprolol, unclear if on coumadin -Hypothyroidism -Hypertension -?

He represented to [**Hospital3 **] Emergency Room with crushing substernal chest pain.  At the outside hospital he had evidence of an inferior myocardial infarction with ST elevations in leads II, III and F.  He was treated with 100 mg bolus of TPA and initially had symptom improvement, however, soon afterwards, his ST elevations returned and the patient became hypotensive to pressure of 50 systolic.  At [**Hospital3 6592**] he was placed on Dopamine gtt, intubated, given an Integrilin 50.5 ml bolus 11 ml per hour afterwards and transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for a catheterization.  Presenting to the catheterization laboratory, catheterization revealed a very small right coronary artery with good collaterals to left anterior descending, chronically occluded left anterior descending and evidence of circumflex disease. The patient underwent angioplasty of his left circumflex artery which he tolerated well, although he did have ST elevations during the procedure, they resolved after angioplasty.  The patient did have profuse bleeding from his right groin site and his oropharynx during the procedure.  The patient's INR and PTT were checked and found to be 9.0 and 89 respectively, which was an elevation of an INR of 1.03 and PTT of 26.8 at the outside hospital.  It should be noted that the patient was not on Coumadin and no heparin was given.\\n\\nMEDICAL HISTORY: 1.

This was possibly associated with seizure activity, although no bystander accounts were available.  Upon arrival to the outside hospital, her vital signs were temperature 98.8, pulse 42, blood pressure 132/56, respiratory rate 14, oxygen saturation 96% on room air.  In the Emergency Department she had witnessed ventricular tachycardia with positive loss of consciousness and seizure activity.  A precordial thump reverted the patient to sinus bradycardia.  The ventricular tachycardia then recurred and precordial thump delivered again with reversion to sinus bradycardia.  She received two runs of potassium at 10 milliequivalents along with 40 milliequivalents or oral potassium.  Lidocaine drip was started at 1 mg per hour.  No future episodes of ventricular tachycardia were noted.  The patient was also noted to have long pauses on telemetry associated with dizziness.  She was transferred to the Coronary Care Unit at the outside hospital where she was started on heparin 1200 units per hour without bolus, and lidocaine drip with increase at 2 mg per hour. The patient was then transferred there that day to [**Hospital1 1444**] for possible coronary catheterization and EP study.  On arrival here the patient was confused with poor recollection of the days events.  She denies chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, lightheadedness.\\n\\nMEDICAL HISTORY: 1.

He was consequently discharged home on [**2188-10-21**] but then readmitted on [**2188-10-27**] which is the date of this admission.  The reason for this readmission was that the patient continued to have developed temperatures and a high white cell count while an outpatient and developed increasing left upper quadrant pain.  On this occasion, he was readmitted and CAT scanned and a fluid collection which was not evident on the previous admission was drained.

Patient was admitted to the Neurology Service to rule out an acute stroke versus exacerbation of Parkinson's disease.  Patient was found to have new left arm and leg weakness on admission.  Patient had a CAT scan of the head done on [**10-28**] secondary to his not being able to tolerate MRI.  Patient was found to have a massive right frontotemporal parietal subdural hemorrhage with fluid level and midline shift and neurosurgery was consulted at that time.

Pt's history dates back to admission in [**8-15**] for altered mental status where pt was found to have hypercalcemia and hypernatremia and was diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia and a UTI during that hospitalization. She was also found to have a LLE DVT and was anticoagulated with heparin. While supratherapeutic on heparin, she had am episode of coffee-ground emesis which resolved with a stable hematocrit. Pt had been discharged at that time with plans for outpatient EGD.  Pt had been doing well until day PTA [**11-21**] when at nursing home (NH), pt developed a temp of 104.8 and three episodes of coffee-ground emesis. There was a question of an aspiration event and the patient's oxygen saturation was noted to drop. In the ED, the patient's temperature was 103.2 with heart rate 102. Oxygen saturation was 89% on RA and she was placed on a NRB mask. She refused an NG lavage, but while in the ED vomited ~100cc of brown/black liquid. She was given 3200cc of NS and subsequently noted to have audible wheezing with respiratory distress and was started on IV NTG, which was titrated up with improvement in respiratory status. She was given Vancomycin, levofloxacin, and metronidazole for presumed aspiration pneumonia. Over the course of her stay in the ED, her SBP progressively dropped to 70s-80s despite 3 L IVF and stopping nitro gtt and pt was then started on peripheral levophed (family refused central line).  Pt was then admitted to MICU for further monitoring. . In MICU, blood cultures drawn [**11-21**] grew out GPC in clusters and GNR, +UTI on U/A (urine culture still pending).

He was well until [**2121-7-11**] when his CEA began to rise.  Workup revealed a left lower lobe nodule and a right upper lobe mass.  He underwent a VATS resection of the right upper lobe on [**2121-12-10**] and the pathology revealed a metastatic tumor from a colonic origin.  Mediastinal lymph node sampling was negative. He then underwent a left lower lobe wedge resection on [**2122-1-22**] of the left lower lobe nodule and this was also consistent with a colonic metastasis.  He began tx with FOLFOX + Avastin.  He required a 20% dose reduction of 5FU bolus and CI due to n/v and abdominal cramping.  He completed 3 cycles of this, last dose on [**2122-6-4**].

At the time of the fall, the nursing aid denies LOC. Did not fall to ground. Per report patient initally complained of head and right hip pain after the fall. She was initially evaluated at [**Location (un) 620**] and found to have a subarachnoid hemorrhage on head CT. VS at [**Location (un) 620**] were T 98.4/HR88/RR15/BP134/73/O296%RA with GCS of 13. She was loaded with Dilantin x 1g and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation. . In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, she was seen by Neurosurgery who did not feel there was any surgical intervention. Hip, femur, and knee films were negative. VS in our ED were BP 130's - 160's/50's to 80's, HR 69-90, RR 13-22, GCS 15. . During her MICU course, she was minimally alert and nearly unresponsive. She was described to variably answer simple yes and no questions. She had f/u head CT, which demonstrated stable subarachnoid hemorrhage, and she was followed by Neurosurgery. She was treated with Dilantin for seizure prophylaxis, and she was given Morphine IV prn for pain; nursing reports that she had pain behavior consisting of moaning and grimacing that responded well to prn Morphine. The primary MICU team held extensive discusssion with the caregiver/health care proxy in regards to her poor prognosis. Additionally, she developed an inferior ST elevation MI with markedly positive cardiac biomarkers and associated bradycardia/hypotension. The caretaker was informed of all this, and decision was made to only provide minimal supportive care. Specifically, there would be no aggresive therapy (ASA, heparin, etc) for her STEMI given her overall poor prognosis and also her intracranial hemorrhage.\\n\\nMEDICAL HISTORY: Alzheimer's Dementia - baseline MS alert to person only Hypothyroidism Right hip replacement\\n\\nMEDICATION ON ADMISSION: .\\n\\nALLERGIES: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs\\n\\nPHYSICAL EXAM: Vitals (on transfer to floor): T 96.3, BP 90/62, HR 43, RR 16, 96% RA General: Sleepy but arousable, NAD; opens eyes to command, pupils small, minimally reactive HEENT: hematoma over right temple CV: RRR, 2/6 systolic murmur Lungs: Clear bilaterally (anteriorally) Abdomen: Soft, nondistended, nontender, +BS Extremities: warmth/erythema/edema in RUE at previous IV site Neuro: arousable to voice and painful stimuli; moves all 4 extremities to painful stimuli, not giving verbal answers to questions.\\n\\nFAMILY HISTORY: Unknown\\n\\nSOCIAL HISTORY: Lives at [**Hospital3 **]\",\n",

Of note, she was admitted to the OSH twice last month due to CHF exacerbations.  She had been doing fine at rehab until [**2192-3-28**] when she went for a doctor's appointment and got acutely short of breath - by the time she arrived at the OSH ED she had decreased level of consciousness and was intubated.  She had pulmonary edema as well as ?RLL infiltrate.  During her OSH stay, she was ruled out for acute MI, diuresed, and treated for CAP with Ceftriaxone and Azithromycin.  Leukocytosis reportedly decreased from 15 on admission to 5 on the day of transfer. Left subclavian CVL was subsequently placed and CVP was [**2-23**], with decrease inurine output.  Given her prior aggressive diuresis, she was given 500cc IVF followed by maintenance IVF and 1u pRBC with improvement in her urine output.  Creatinine is at baseline.  Also, her hospital stay has been notable for anemia.  Her baseline Hct is 24.  Upon OSH admission her Hct was 28, but today was 20 in the setting of the fluid boluses and she is reportedly guaiac negative.  She is a very difficult cross-match; did receive one unit pRBCs with repeat Hct prior to transfer of 23.7.  On arrival to the CCU, she is intubated and sedated.

Bronchial washings were positive for adenocarcinoma and the transbronchial biopsy showed atypical cells suspicious for large cell carcinoma. He has undergone imaging that includes both CT of the head on [**2116-6-17**] that shows no metastatic disease.  CTA of the chest shows a left perihilar mass that is 4.0 x 1.9 cm.  This mass is centered in the left lower lobe, but does partially encase the left lower lobe superior segment PA.  There are also two nodules in the left upper lobe and a 0.9-cm nodule at the right apex. PET scan performed on [**8-11**] shows the hilar mass to be FDG avid with an SUV of 17.  The left upper lobe nodule is non-FDG avid as are other pulmonary nodules.  There was no metastatic disease on this study.

He was initially diagnosed with HSV 1 meningitis on [**2190-4-23**].  He presented after he was in an accident while driving from RI to VT, rented a second car, and was in a second accident, at which point he was brought to an outside hospital and eventually diagnosed with HSV meningitis.  He was started on a course of IV acyclovir, and discharged to [**Hospital 38**] rehab.  His rehab course was complicated by a lower extremity DVT, for which he was started on Coumadin, however on [**5-15**] there was concern that the clot was mobile, and on [**2190-5-16**] he had an IVC filter placed. Around this time he became febrile to 102.6, and on [**5-18**] was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for fever and worsening confusion.  He was admitted from [**Date range (1) 66375**], during which time he underwent a repeat LP, which showed 56 WBCs and a protein of 83, but was HSV negative.  He had blood and urine cultures that were also negative.  His fevers resolved with restarting acyclovir, though his mental status continued to fluctuate, and he was sent back to rehab on [**5-21**].  His sister continued to visit him, and reports that even as recently as two days ago he was actually starting to improve.  At his best he was reported to be communicative, with a slightly strange affect, and mild short term memory and executive function impairment.  However, on [**5-26**] he was noted to be very unsteady with PT, and was found to be orthostatic as low of SBP of 60 when standing, and it was recommended that he start both fludrocortisone and midodrine.  On [**5-27**] the patient was noted to be forcibly keeping his right eye closed, and also was felt to be more apraxic with worsening coordination.  He was also felt to not be moving his right arm as frequently.

He had mild developmental delay as a child, and then at age 7 or 8 years had prolonged (greater than 24 hours) status epilepticus with probable anoxic brain injury in the setting of a febrile illness. Subsequently, he had severe static encephalopathy and intractable epilepsy. He currently resides in a group home. He is nonverbal, but does understand some language. He requires assistance with most activities of daily living. He has some obstinate behavior, but no aggression or agitated behavior recently.  His typical seizures are of 2 types: #1) episodes of rapid eye blinking, staring, and urinary incontinence, unclear frequency, and #2) episodes of facial grimacing, stiffening of his limbs, some lip smacking, and incontinence of urine and stool, occurring 3-4 times per year.  For the past week or so, his group home staff have noticed that he has had more difficulty with balance. This is somewhat similar to symptoms he had in [**2186-10-30**], when he presented with ataxia and increased seizures in the setting of pneumonia. His balance problems became more severe yesterday, and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] recommended getting labs and AED levels. The staff was unable to get him to walk to come to the clinic. They called EMS and he was transported to [**Hospital1 18**] ER. There he was found to be hypothermic to 92, hypoglycemic 61, with borderline blood pressure SBP 80s. He subsequently had 3 seizures of type #2 lasting several minutes. He received a total of 2 mg of Ativan and was loaded with IV Dilantin. He had oxygen desaturation and was therefore transferred to the ICU. There, his blood pressure remained borderline and he required 6 L of IV fluids.  Today, he has had a total of 11 seizures so far, with one to 2 per hour.

Per EMS note, on their arrival at 11pm yesterday, they found a \\\"cluttered apartment with a disheveled\\\" patient. FSG was 110. . The patient's daughter reports that the patient has had decreased use of his right hand for at least several days. Over this time, the wrist has become contracted. She reports a prior episode months ago where his left wrist was similarly involved. He was evaluated at this time by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10442**], who found L wrist dystonia. MRI C-spine showed spondylosis at multiple levels and MRI brain was normal. . Over this time period, the daughter feels that the patient's walking has gotten slightly worse, from a baseline deterioration over months. He has had a harder time getting up into his walker. She says that he \\\"slipped\\\" today when she was trying to get him into a wheelchair from the bed. . She has noted no other new complaints. No facial droop or other weakness.

When pressed about the right wrist posture, he says that this too has been going on for that time  period. He feels that his speech is worse today, in that \\\"people cannot understand what I'm saying\\\" and he feels that it may be more slurred than usual. This has not had a sudden onset but rather fluctuates throughout the day, he feels. He complains of generalized fatigue. . He reports blurry vision for one week or more, in both eyes and all fields of vision. No diplopia. No vertigo. No numbness or tingling. He feels his legs are stiff and have been so for over a year, \\\"slowly but surely\\\" getting worse. Review of systems is otherwise negative. .

He was initially alert but not very cooperative and subsequently became increasingly agitated and combative and was ultimately intubated for airway protection.

On presentation, she was hypotensive, hypoxic, and had bright red blood in her urine. She was found to have extraperitoneal ruptured bladder and bilateral non-displaced pubic rami fx's (R inferior and L superior). . She was seen by Urology and Surgery on admission for evaluation of ruptured bladder as well as pelvic fractures. Surgical intervention was not indicated for either problem. [**Name (NI) 8389**] placed for decompression. . Regarding hypotension/hypoxia, she was given IVF resuscitation for hypotension and presumably became volume overloaded in the setting of AS. She then developed hypoxia, initially with poor sats on facemask. She was not intubated. CXR was notable for RLL collapse presumed due to mucus plug as well as b/l pleural effusions secondary to volume overload. She was initially diuresed with a Lasix gtt with suboptimal effect, transitioned to Lasix boluses (20mg IV) with good effect (last dose IV dose was at 8:30am [**2188-7-5**]). At the time of transfer to medicine, she was 2.5L negative through her LOS and had O2 sats of 94-95% on 4-5L O2. . On HD2 she flipped into AFib. It was thought that pulm edema pushed her back in AFib, so she was bolused and started on po amiodarone. Flipped back into Afib with RVR twice in SICU, each time she was bolused with 150 IV Amio and transitioned back into NS.

Urine grew pseudomonas in her urine and got 1 dose of ceftriaxone. . She received 1u PRBC's for Hct 35 because her baseline was felt to be 40's. . There was concern about her pain control and concern for splinting, so had an epidural catheter placed for pain control, and pain service was following, using Dilaudid and Bupivicaine. . She had an NG in for feeding that was removed as she improved, removed the day of transfer to medicine. PT has been consulted, needs two person assist, has been OOB to chair qday.

In [**9-11**] she was treated with rituximab and her ITP seemed to respond. However, she felt fatigued, had night sweats, and experienced weight loss, all of an unclear etiology. She was thought to perhaps have URIs but eventually went to her PCP who found that her LFTs were elevated. Imaging revealed multiple small nodules in her liver worrisome for metastatic malignancy. However, CT guided biopsy in [**2-11**] was w/o evidence of malignancy. . At this point, she was transfused due to worsening anemia. This temporarily improved her symptoms. Then in [**3-13**], she began to notice a decline in her cognitive function. This was marked to the patient at her work in human resources. She found that she was having difficulty \\\"connecting\\\" with people and completeing tasks. . She was admitted to [**Hospital1 498**] for an extensive workup.

At that admission, the patient had a cardiac catheterization which revealed a fresh thrombus in her saphenous vein graft to D-1, and it was decided that no intervention was undertaken at that time. During this admission, her peak CK's rose to 910 and her troponin was noted to be greater than 50.  Upon discharge, she had been chest pain free for 48 hours and was ambulatory at the time of discharge.

The following evening, at approximately 8 p.m., the patient developed a sudden onset of [**9-9**] substernal chest pain.  The pain was described as crushing pressure radiating to the neck.  It was associated with nausea, though the patient denied vomiting, palpitations or shortness of breath.  The pain was unrelieved by sublingual nitroglycerin times three. The patient called the EMS and was brought to the Emergency Room where initial vital signs were stable.  The patient was started on morphine p.r.n. with a nitroglycerin drip.  Her EKG at presentation had no changes from her baseline.  With these medications, her chest pain was reduced to [**2205-3-6**] and the patient was started on hirudin.  The emergency course was remarkable for the sudden resurgence of chest pain while on nitroglycerin and hirudin. Subsequently, her blood pressure dropped to 60/30 for about 10 minutes and the patient was intubated secondary to impending respiratory arrest.  Her blood pressure increased with 1.5 liters of IV fluid and peripheral dopamine at 15 mcg/kg per minute.  The Emergency Room course was also notable for spontaneous extubation for which she was reintubated.  A right IJ was placed for access.  Her blood pressure stabilized at 130/70 with a heart rate of 80 on 15 mcg/kg per minute of dopamine.  The patient did experience another slight decrease in her blood pressure to 90's/60's with administration of 100 mcg of fentanyl.  The patient was then taken to the catheterization laboratory for emergent cardiac catheterization. Catheterization revealed a left main coronary artery of 40% ostial lesion, left anterior descending with 70% ulcerated stenosis proximally, and left circumflex with mild luminal irregularities.  Interventional Cardiology and Cardiothoracic Surgery reviewed these films and decision was made to perform PTCA stenting of the left anterior lesion with 3.0 velocity at 18 mm, and 2.5 velocity 8 mm.\\n\\nMEDICAL HISTORY: 1.

The history is given both by the patient and his daughter.  Apparently, the patient lives predominantly alone.  His daughter recalls speaking to him on Saturday and he appeared to be his typical self.  This morning, around 9am she received a phone call from her father- he was asking for the phone number to his office, something he should know very well.  She became concerned and he told her that he was not feeling well and was lying in bed (also unlike him).  They hung up the phone and just minutes later, he called back, again asking the same questions and without recalling that he had just spoken to her.  This prompted his daughter to go to his home where she found things in disarray- he had apparently soiled himself as well as vomited on the floor as well as a nose bleed and had no cleaned it up.  She is not sure how long things had been like that.  The patient refused to go to the ED and requested calling his PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **].  Upon hearing this, the PCP rightfully referred the pt to the ED.  On arrival to the ED, the patient was noted to be extremely hypoxic (O2 sat 65% off oxygen).  ABG at the time showed mild bicarb retention and normal COhb. EKG was notable for PACs.  A head CT was obtained which identifed a large intraventricular bleed in the left caudate, extending into the ventricular system. Neurosurgery was consulted but felt there was no issued for an acute intervention.  His sats quickly correctly and neurology was consulted.

She was taken to the OR and found to have infarction of her colon with intact small bowel. She under went a colectomy with iliostomy at that time. Post op had respiratory failure requiring prolonged intubation and eventual tracheostomy. The etiology of her respiratory failure was unclear at her discharge. She was discharged to [**Location (un) 4368**] [**Hospital 21079**] rehab on [**2158-6-1**] after ~30 day hospitalization on TPN via CVL with tube feeds started. The plan was to advance tube feeds and wean TPN.   On [**2158-6-17**], she was still on TPN at rehab and spiked a temperature up to 103 and blood cultures were positive for yeast ([**Female First Name (un) **] albicans by telephone report but not documented in transfer records). She was transferred to [**Hospital3 417**] in [**Hospital1 1474**] for further management. There she was initially given voriconazole and her central line replaced. Culture from the line again reportedly grew [**Female First Name (un) **]. She was then switched to fluconazole and finally to caspofungin today. She was also treated with ticarcillin/clavulanate for unclear reasons. During her hospitalization, she also had a \\\"troponin leak\\\" without EKG changes thought to be demand ischemia by their cardiology consultants. An echo done on [**2158-6-18**] showed global hypokinesis with EF 25-30%, dilated LA, LVH, moderated MR, moderate TR, although image quality was poor. Her hospitalization was also complicated by hyponatremia of unclear [**Name2 (NI) 10810**].   Her hospitalization was also complicated by acute on chronic renal failure (s/p transplant in [**2143**]). She did have episode of ATN in setting of her mesenteric ischemia with peak Cr of 4.3 with return to her baseline of 1.4-1.8 at time of discharge. Upon admission to [**Hospital3 417**] her Cr was 3.7 and remained elevated. It is unclear what work up was done for this. On the day of admission, she also developed respiratory distress with increasing volume retention. Attempts at diuresis with Lasix 400 mg IV were unsuccesful. She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for management of her fungemia, renal failure and repiratory distress.

She was briefly treated with noninvasive mask ventilation and her ventilator status improved such that she was off noninvasive mask ventilation within 24 hours.  On that admission she was noted to chronically hypoventilate.  Chest x-ray at the time showed left lower lobe atelectasis.  Pulmonary function tests done in early [**Month (only) **] showed a restrictive pattern with an FEV1 of 45% of predicted, an FVC of 34% of predicted with a ratio of 133% of predicted.  Additionally a TLC was 53% of predicted, FRC was 70% of predicted, RV was 81% of predicted. The RV to TLC ratio was 153% of predicted.  DSB (VA) was 46% of predicted consistent with moderate reduction of diffusion capacity suggesting the possibility of interstitial disease, in addition to the likely neuromuscular disease that was suggested by her lung volumes.  Electromyogram was performed to assess for neurologic causes and showed no evidence for disorder of neuromuscular transmission, though there was some paraspinal denervation present acutely.  Additionally, an MRI of the brain showed no lesions that might cause central apnea.  Over the course of that hospitalization the acidosis resolved without specific intervention and on discharge her blood gases showed a pH of 7.4 and PCO2 of 71.  She was discharged home on [**2114-7-14**].  The patient had been doing well at home although she had complained of some fatigue over the last three weeks. According to her sons she had two very active days just prior to the day of admission.  At 7 AM on the day of admission her sons left the house to go to work and reported that their mother was awake although still in bed.  They returned home at approximately 9 PM and found their mother still in her pajamas, face down in the bed with decreased respirations. They performed rescue breathing and the patient was brought to the [**Hospital1 69**] Emergency Department by EMS.  On arrival her blood gas showed a pH of 7.09, PCO2 of 119, PO2 of 198 and a bicarbonate of 38 with lactate of 7.4 and she was initiated on BiPAP and transferred to the medical intensive care unit for further management.

The patient had been previously managed on beta blockers and calcium channel blockers, but her symptoms were worsening.  She was given a Holter Monitor and returned to her primary care physician's office where she was complaining of increased palpitations.  At her primary care physician's office, her blood pressure was found to be somewhat low and a subsequently EKG revealed ventricular tachycardia.  She was work-up.  At [**Last Name (un) 1724**], she was stable in monomorphic ventricular tachycardia and essentially asymptomatic.  Attempted cardioversion with amiodarone was unsuccessful and her ventricular tachycardia persisted with some increased shortness of breath.  She was therefore DC cardioverted and transferred to [**Hospital1 346**] for an Electrophysiology study and potential ventricular tachycardia ablation.  At [**Hospital1 69**], she was taken to the Electrophysiology Laboratory for attempted ventricular tachycardia ablation.  The procedure was complicated by decreased blood pressures to the 80s systolic.  Subsequent cardiac echocardiogram revealed a 1.5 cm hemodynamically significant pericardial effusion with right atrial pressures of around 25 by pulmonary artery catheterization.  She also had recurrent ventricular tachycardia in the Electrophysiology Laboratory and was given a Lidocaine drip. Pericardiocentesis was performed in which we drained approximately 250 cc of blood with subsequent normalization of blood pressures.  The patient was therefore transferred to the Cardiac Care Unit where again she experienced a decrease in blood pressures. An additional amount of fluid was drained.  Her blood pressures subsequently normalized. In addition, the patient had an elevated CPK, MB and troponin. Lidocaine was eventually discontinued and she was switched to amiodarone plus Mexitil and aggressively diuresed secondary to congestive heart failure.  She was eventually cardioverted on [**2137-8-13**] from atrial fibrillation back to normal sinus rhythm.  Today, she was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] Service for further evaluation.\\n\\nMEDICAL HISTORY: 1.  Hypertension. 2.  History of atrial fibrillation. 3.

She had a crushing injury between her left and right abdomen.  She was transferred to [**Hospital 6930**] [**Hospital 12018**] Hospital at that time, and during her work-up there was no evidence of any internal injury.  She was stable, observed and sent home.  Approximately one week after being sent home, she became increasingly dyspneic, and was brought to [**Hospital 1514**] Hospital on [**2133-11-15**].  She was ill and on work-up she was found to have free air in the abdomen. She was taken to the Operating Room where she was found to have a perforation of the distal ileum and intestinal contents filling her abdomen.  A side-to-side functional end-to-end anastomosis was made after resection of the perforation three feet from the ileocecal valve.  G- and J-tubes were placed intraoperatively, and she had tolerated that procedure well.  One week after that procedure, it was noted that a bilious nature was draining from her wound and she was taken back to the Operating Room for re-exploration and found that the sites of the G- and J-tubes were leaking intestinal contents into the abdomen.  The tubes were changed and she tolerated that procedure well.  Afterwards, she continued to leak and she was brought back to the Operating Room for a third time on [**12-12**]/200.  The G-tube site was closed with a TX-60 mm stapler and oversewn with #3-0 Silk sutures.  The J-tube site was oversewn with #3-0 Prolene sutures.  After the third procedure, she continued to appear to be leaking from her wound and continued to have what was now characterized as a small enterocutaneous fistula.  During her time at this hospital, she was placed on TPN, continued NPO and had a nasogastric tube.  They had placed a VAC dressings in the wound containing the fistula, which was draining approximately one liter a day.  She had undergone a tracheostomy tube placement on [**12-12**].  On [**2133-11-26**], she had undergone a catheter insertion for starting TPN. During this procedure, it was noted that after the wire insertion, the patient developed premature ventricular contractions, subsequently turned to ventricular tachycardia and then ventricular fibrillation arrest.  She was shocked and underwent ACLS protocol.  She was recovered into sinus rhythm after one shock.  The line was aborted at that time. A line was then successfully placed afterwards.  She was then being transferred on [**2133-12-29**], to [**Hospital1 346**] under the care of Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 957**] of her enterocutaneous fistula.\\n\\nMEDICAL HISTORY: 1.

Mr. [**Known lastname **] has been admitted approximately once per month since [**1-/2168**] for [**Year (4 digits) **], CHF, sepsis, and line infections. His most recent hospital admission to the [**Hospital1 18**] was from [**2168-9-6**] to [**2168-9-8**] for CHF in the setting of poorly controlled hypertension. The patient was discharged on [**2168-9-8**] to his nursing home facility where, per report from [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 32726**] at the home, the patient returned to his baseline state of health. Mr. [**Known lastname **] did well until the evening prior to admission, when the staff found him to be shouting more than normal. At baseline, the patient shouts infrequently in his native Creole language, but the staff noted that he was shouting more frequently last night; they also note that he seemed more confused than normal. In addition, Mr. [**Known lastname **] did not sleep much on the evening prior to admission. He denied any pain symptoms when questioned by the staff. On the morning of admission, the patient was taken to dialysis at [**Location (un) **] Dialysis where he screamed continuously and held his groin area (the site of a femoral line). Due to concern about the patient's change in mental status and possible pain at the femoral line site, he did not undergo his dialysis treatment and was taken to the [**Hospital1 18**] emergency department for evaluation. . In the ED, the patient's vital signs were: T 95.5, HR 90, BP 158/98, RR 16, O2Sat 99/RA. The patient underwent a CT of the head and chest x-ray. The CXR showed chronic LLL consolidation, RLL consolidation that had been noted on the previous admission and has not yet resolved, as well as small bilateral pleural effusions. The CT of the head showed no acute intracranial pathology. The patient was given 1 gram of ceftazidime, 1 gram of vancomycin, epoetin, 5 mcg of paricalcitol, 62.5 mg of ferric gluconate. Mr. [**Known lastname **] was found to be hyperkalemic and to have an INR of 1.3. Given the persistence of the RLL consolidation, the patient was admitted to the [**Hospital1 139**] general medical service for work-up of his mental status change and treatment of pneumonia. . Review of Systems: Per report from [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 32726**] at the Nursing Home, the patient has not had any recent cough, fever, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. She says that his blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation have all been normal over the last several days. . MICU Txfer: Reason for transfer: Bradyacardia and AMS . During his hospitalization, his mental status improved on antibiotics. He was initially treated with Levo/Flagyl, changed to Cefepime and Tobramycin and Flagyl when his cultures grew out Enterobacteriae; subsequently this was changed to Meropenem as it was felt that he may have an ESBL organism. . On [**2168-9-18**], patient was alert and conversing with team. On [**2168-9-19**], patient was found to be unresponsive/lethargic and bradycardic to the 40s. He was in Afib and did not have any changes on his EKG. His pressure was in the 90s at this heart rate. His finger sticks were normal. He was afebrile. His last nodal agents was 9pm on [**2168-9-18**] (he is on metoprolol 25mg [**Hospital1 **]) and his last sedatives were olanzapine at 10am on [**2168-9-18**] and trazodone at 9pm on [**2168-9-18**]. On the floor, he was given atropine x 2 and his heart rate increased to 60s after 1st atropine and his BP increased to the 110s. However, his mentation did not improve. CT of head showed ?stroke, but Neuro consulted and felt not c/w pt presentation. . On Transfer to floor from MICU: Summary of MICU course--The episode of AMS that brought him to the MICU was accompanied by bradycardia and hypotension. He was started on dopamine; as his HR and BP picked up so did his mentation. Neuro was consulted about a finding of possible stroke on CT which they felt was not clinically consistent with his physical exam. . His vitals signs were stable and mental status improved and he was called out to floor.\\n\\nMEDICAL HISTORY: 1) Left occipital lobe CVA [**2-22**] p/w change in MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **], chronic CVAs now on coumadin for likely embolic nature 2) Paroxysmal Afib, rate controlled with tachy/brady, occas 2 sec pauses, best managed with metoprolol 75 tid per cards 3) Chronic eosinophilia unknown etiology, strongyloides sent in [**2-22**] for w/u as well as SPEP/UPEP 4) h/o GI Bleed in [**2167-7-20**] while on asa, plavix, IIb/IIIa post-cath--no EGD or C-scope performed in f/u yet 5) ESRD secondary to HTN, dialysis MWF- followed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 805**]  6) h/o bacteremia w/ MRSA (most recently diagnosed on admission from [**8-10**] to [**2168-8-17**]) on Vancomycin until [**2168-9-23**]. 7) h/o pulling out groin lines 8) HTN, controlled 9) CAD s/p NSTEMIS, 2 LAD stents, CABG [**2164**]: last ECHO [**2167-8-27**],  EF >55% 10) Hyperlipidemia 11) Diverticulosis 12) Severe Hyperparathyroidism, presumed adenoma, not on vitamin  D for this concern 13) chronic anemia 14) chronic transudative pleural effusions 15) h/o neurocysticercosis calcified\\n\\nMEDICATION ON ADMISSION: Docusate Sodium 100 mg Capsule One Capsule PO BID (2 times a day) B Complex-Vitamin C-Folic Acid 1 mg Capsule One Cap PO daily Sevelamer 800 mg Tablet One Tablet PO TID (3 times a day).

Successful placement of a temporary pacing wire which was placed for Wenckebach and bradycardia.  Left main coronary artery disease, mildly diffuse, 70-80% left anterior descending artery stenosis, and the mid right coronary artery with 70% stenosis, distal right totally occluded.  Cardiac echocardiogram was done on [**2151-4-8**] which revealed an ejection fraction of 30% with left ventricular systolic function moderately-to-severely depressed secondary to hypokinesis of the inferior septum and the inferior free wall and moderate hypokinesis of the posterior wall.  There is no A.I, no mitral valve prolapse, and 1+ mitral regurgitation.  Patient underwent coronary artery bypass grafting x3 with the left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending, saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal and saphenous vein graft to the diagonal branch of the left circumflex on [**2151-5-6**] as well as paracardial patch of the inferior ventricular aneurysm.

Postoperative day two, the patient's chest tube output decreasing with a 24 hour total of 1400 hematocrit stable at 33.  The patient went into atrial fibrillation overnight, and was administered Lopressor as well as an amiodarone drip, and because the patient's cardiac index continued to be on the low side at 1.96, the patient continued to receive milrinone at 0.25.  Postoperative day three, patient was administered a 150 mg IV bolus of IV milrinone for the atrial fibrillation with a rate of 90 to 100's.  He blocked down to sinus bradycardic, and was continued to be A-paced at 80.  Still with an index hovering around 2.0 on the milrinone drip at 0.125.  Patient's chest tubes drained 675 over the last 24 hours with a hematocrit of 29.9.  Patient continued to go in and out of atrial fibrillation for which she was administered amiodarone boluses as well as Lopressor with good effect, converted back to sinus with a good ventricular rate.  The patient was taken off the milrinone with a stable cardiac index ranging between 1.9-2.  The patient was transferred to the floor on postoperative day #5 in stable condition in normal sinus rhythm in the 70's with a pacer off, however, attached.  Postoperative day six 24 hour events included the patient going in and out of atrial fibrillation again while on the floor.  However, converting back to sinus rhythm with a stable heart rate of 80.

The patient had a long recent hospitalization at [**Hospital1 18**] last month after having increased seizure frequency and a prolonged seizure in the epilepsy clinic.

Per notes, she had been staying at a shelter because her power was out in her home. She was found unresponsive and was bradycardic to the 20s and hypotensive. She was taken to [**Hospital3 7569**] where she had an emergent temporary transvenous pacer placed. She also was intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure. The initial cause of her bradycardiac was unclear but felt possibly to be related to digoxin toxicity for which she received digibind. She was subsequently treated for a COPD exacerbation with high dose solumedrol, zosyn and azithromycin. She also was noted to have acute renal failure thought by nephrology to be consistent with acute tubular necrosis in the setting of profound hypotension and was treated with lasix for decreased urine ouput. There was also concern for gastrointestinal bleeding as her hematocrit on presentation was 19.4 and she received two units of packed red blood cells. She was extubated on hospital day two without difficulty. She had an echocardiogram which showed preserved systolic function but pulmonary hypertension with a pulmonary artery pressure of 50 mm. The Zosyn was discontinued when the patient began to experience a drop in her platelet count to as low as 56k. On hospital day three she underwent a thoracentesis for a left sided pleural effusion which was consistent with a transudate with LDH 88, ratio 0.3, Prot 3.0. She continued to have loose black guaiac positive stools. She was started on IV flagyl and PO vancomycin out of concern for clostridium difficile although c. diff samples were negative x 1. Renal function has improved from a creatinine of 2.6 on admission to 1.7. She also suffered from a burn to her back from a heating pad used while she had the transvenous pacer placed and developed a stage II decubitous ulcer. The temporary pacer was removed prior to transfer.  On arrival here the patient noted that she has been experiencing chest tightness since her endotracheal tube was removed. On arrival her heart rate was in the 140s in atrial fibrillation with blood pressures in the 160s systolic. She had a nitroglycerin patch on and it was unclear whether this was being used for chest pain or for blood pressure control. She received 5 mg IV metoprolol x 2 with good control of her heart rate.  She currently denies lightheadedness or dizziness. She continues to experience chest tightness. Her breathing feels at baseline to her. She endorses mild nausea but no vomiting. She denies abdominal pain but endorses dark stools with diarrhea. She denies dysuria, hematuria or decreased urine output. She denies leg pain or swelling. She does note that she was admitted to [**Location (un) **] in [**Month (only) 547**] of this year with gastrointestinal bleeding and had a procedure but she does not recall what was found.

Her first admission was at [**Hospital6 8432**] Center [**Date range (1) 32462**] when she presented with vomiting and diarrhea thought to be from viral gastroenteritis. All cultures and tests were negative and she improved from the gastroenteritis. After discharge she developed upper respiratory symptoms. She was given 10 days of tamiflu for recent outbreak at her rehab. She reportedly did not have any mental status changes, new rash or changes in PO intake. She then was admitted at Eastern [**State 1727**] for a second time on [**3-20**] - [**3-25**] with fever 104.5 and blood pressure 90/50. She was empirically started on antibiotics given her immunocompromised state but cultures were negative. She did eventually grow RSV, which was the only pathogen detected to cause her fevers.

The patient underwent emergent surgery in New [**Country 6679**]. A bicoronal craniectomy and insertion of right frontal extraventricular catheter was performed for a complex right frontal fracture extending through his frontal sinus and along the roof of his orbits. There was extensive facial fracturing and massive bilateral frontal contusions, worse on the right. The patient has recovered from his surgery with significant impairment secondary to his TBI. He follows up with us because sequential imaging has revealed that he has dilated ventricles which seem to be out of proportion to the amount of injury that he sustained.  The question is whether the patient would benefit from ventricular shunting as well as shunting from bifrontal hygromas. The patient is seen with his parents in the office. The patient is in a wheelchair. He is able to communicate in limited phrases. He remains oriented to himself and to his family, he is  not fully oriented to other qualities. He can follow commands.

He had a cardiac catheterization in [**Month (only) 216**], which revealed severe biventricular failure with mild pulmonary hypertension, 2+ mitral regurgitation and normal coronary arteries.  An RV endomyocardial biopsy was negative for sarcoidosis.  He was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit for Milrinone drip and for several days after the catheterization.  In [**2184-8-21**] an AICD was placed prophylactically for ventricular ectopy.  Over the next several months congestive heart failure improved from class three to class one and he was able to go back to work on an assembly line.  Symptoms of dyspnea and fatigue returned about a month ago when he began working full time.  At that time he became several short of breath when walking up a flight of stairs, which is consistent with congestive heart failure class three.  His medications had been adjusted in the past several weeks with resulting hypertension.  He had a stress test on [**2185-2-8**] to evaluate exercise tolerance where he exercised for fifteen minutes on the Dobutamine protocol, which was then stopped for hypertension at peak exercise.  His blood pressures decreased from 112/60 to 90/64.  He was taken for a cardiac catheterization on [**2185-2-9**], which showed a PA sat prior to dobutamine was 59%.  After 8 micrograms per kilogram of Dobutamine was 70%.  Before Dobutamine his pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was 32, PA of 41, right atrial pressure of HRV pressure 55/8, PA pressures of 55/29 with a mean of 39.  After the Dobutamine his PA pressures were 58/20 with a mean of 38.  Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was 25 with V wave of 40.  He was then transferred to the Coronary Care Unit on Dobutamine drip.  Hemodynamic monitoring, diuresis were continued and anatropic support.  He was also being considered for a cardiac transplant.\\n\\nMEDICAL HISTORY: 1.  Pulmonary sarcoidosis diagnosed in [**2179**].  ESR was 5, base was 16.

She is in a cervicothoracic brace since [**Month (only) 547**] or since early [**Month (only) 116**].  Her past medical history is diagnosis of breast cancer in [**2112**] with lumpectomy, chemo and radiation, not BRCA 1 or 2.  She was diagnosed with spinal metastases in [**2123**] and had radiation.  Her other medical problems are hypertension and high cholesterol.  No other significant medical issues.  Her medications included lisinopril, folic acid, Crestor, calcium, multivitamin, Arimidex, Exgeva, Ativan, and Tegretol.  She has no known drug allergies.  She has a husband and two children.  She does not smoke.  She is currently not working.  Review of systems is negative.  However, she is 5 feet 4 inches, 147 pounds with systolic blood pressure 172/105, pulse 89.  No chest pain, headaches, nausea, or vomiting.  Notes were reviewed from MCCM from [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 9969**] from [**2123-8-6**].  It is noted that she was using Duragesic patches at that time. She remains neurologically intact.  She was on Femara at that point.  A PET scan done on [**2123-6-22**] shows extensive metastases, no visceral metastases.  She was on hormonal therapy as well as Exgeva.  Studies were reviewed.  PET scan done from [**2123-5-25**] done at [**Hospital 1727**] Medical Center, department of radiology shows markedly improved appearance since the last exam _____ vast majority of previously recent osseous lesions no longer demonstrating hypermetabolism with residual uptake destructive lesions in T1-T2.  The images were reviewed.  Unfortunately, the cervicothoracic junction is a cutoff point for the thoracic and no other cervical study, no good overlap study is noted.  On physical examination, she appears to be tolerating her brace well.  She is neurologically intact in upper and lower extremities.  No spasticity.  No atrophy.  Distal pulses intact.  Fine hand motor function is intact.  Gait is within normal limits.  In brief, this is a patient with multiple osseous metastases from breast cancer status post radiation to her spine as well as hormonal therapy.  I recommended a new CT of her cervicothoracic junction and follow up with me.  The goal of the reconstruction would be to free her from her brace.  I do think her life expectancy is significant enough to consider surgical stabilization given the remaining option, which would be to leave her in a brace indefinitely.\\n\\nMEDICAL HISTORY: see HPI\\n\\nMEDICATION ON ADMISSION: lisinopril, folic acid, Crestor, calcium, multivitamin, Arimidex, Exgeva, Ativan, and Tegretol.\\n\\nALLERGIES: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions\\n\\nPHYSICAL EXAM: see HPI\\n\\nFAMILY HISTORY: See HPI\\n\\nSOCIAL HISTORY: see HPI\",\n",

The patient presented several times this year to the Emergency Department for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation, only once requiring intubation ([**4-5**]).  The patient usually responds well to steroids, antibiotics and bronchodilators.  At baseline, the patient is functional and is not oxygen dependent.  During his [**2188-4-4**] Medical Intensive Care Unit admission, stress echocardiogram and cardiac catheterization were performed to rule out ischemia as a cause of low O2 saturations.  The stress echocardiogram showed anterior abnormalities and the cardiac catheterization showed mild to moderate coronary artery disease with no flow limiting lesions; normal filling pressures, left ventricular ejection fraction equal to 55%.  On this admission, the patient states that he had had fevers the night prior to admission and increased wheezing and shortness of breath over the past week due to the \\\"hot weather.\\\"  On the night prior to admission, the patient became very short of breath without relief from his albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers.  The patient denies any chest pain, hemoptysis, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, peripheral edema.  On the date of admission, the patient was playing cards with friends, had an episode of nausea and vomiting which was followed by the patient being found outside gasping for air and asking for oxygen.  EMS arrived on the scene and his O2 saturation was 70%.  The patient was unable to speak, and he was diaphoretic.  In the Emergency Department, his O2 saturation was 84% on nonrebreather with respiratory rate equal to 44.  Blood pressure 120/palp and heart rate equal to 132.  The patient was then intubated.  The patient then proceeded to seize after receiving lidocaine/versed/Succinylcholine/etomidate and resolved spontaneously.

At that time, the patient also had a normal wedge pressure, normal LV function, normal biventricular diastolic function, and a normal ejection fraction.  The patient was admitted primarily for work-up of new chest x-ray and chest CAT scan findings which were diffuse bilateral ground glass opacities, bibasilar thickening of the interlobar septa with honeycombing.  The concern was that the patient may have had a secondary diagnosis in addition to her primary pulmonary hypertension.  Therefore, the patient was admitted to have a right lobe wedge resection performed for pathologic studies.  The differential at the time of this surgery primarily included pulmonary [**Last Name (un) **]-occlusive disease versus pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis.  At the time of admission, the patient was status post chest tube removal. She complained of pleuritic right-sided chest and back discomfort.  She also noted feeling short of breath.  She was persistently nauseated, and she had vomited bilious emesis x 1 on the day of transfer to the MICU.  The patient also noted a cough productive of dark blood 2-3 times a day. Additionally, the patient felt orthopneic.  Chest x-ray upon transfer to the MICU was notable for a new right lower lobe infiltrate consistent with air space disease, most likely lung injury.\\n\\nMEDICAL HISTORY: 1.

Briefly, she had been referred for a GI evaluation of an anemia that had been attributed to her CKD.  She had a colonoscopy which was unrevealing.  She recently had an EGD which showed non-bleeding gastric ulcer, duodenal diverticulum and esophageal stricture.  There was also mention of gastric outlet obstruction.  She was admitted several times to [**Hospital 8641**] Hospital with falling hematocrit and no obvious source.  She had a capsule study to evaluate the small intestine, which was not effective as it was found in her stomach on repeat scope. . This last time she was admitted was after a syncopal episode while having a melanotic stool on Friday. Head CT negative. She was admitted and fluid resuscitated, and found to have a hct of 15%, which was from 30% one day prior.  She was admitted to their ICU, placed on pantoprazole gtt, and had a repeat EGD. This showed normal esophagus, clotted blood in the gastric fundus, and partially obstructing gastric ulcers.  She had recurrent bleeding episodes, mostly melanotic, and has received 7 units of packed red blood cells during admission.  She had a bleeding scan which did not show any acute source of bleeding. She had several episodes of crampy abdominal pain, nausea, melanotic stool, and relative hypotension.  She was trasferred for ongoing care. . Initial admission to the MICU: She had been transfused for a low hematocrit.  She was evaluated by GI, and had an endoscopy.  She had a large ulcer with two possible visible vessels.  She got BICAP / electrocautery.  She also had a deformed pyloric channel, and duodenal bulb diverticulum.  There was hemostasis at the end of the procedure.  Surgery was consulted because of concern for gastric outlet obstruction.  She was stable and called out to the medical floor on [**2168-8-3**]. . On the medical floor she had a stable hematocrit.  PT was done. Surgery continued to follow her, and recommended a CT abd/pelvis to evaluate for mass / cause of GOO.  She had a CT with oral contrast this afternoon, and with drinking the contrast she developed some abdominal discomfort and nausea.  She was given zofran with good result.  Approximately 8 hours after her CT scan, she felt the need to move her bowels, and was feeling lightheaded and shaky.  With assistance, she started to ambulate to the bathroom, but had a pre-syncopal event and fell to her knees.  She was placed in bed, with her BP noted 85/58, tachy to 120's, and feeling dizzy.  She was given IVF bolus, and her BP improved and HR returned toward normal.  She then had a melanotic stool.  She had a STAT hematocrit that was 19% from 29% at 6am.  A unit of packed cells was orderd, and she was transferred to the MICU for closer monitoring and possible endoscopy.\\n\\nMEDICAL HISTORY: - s/p cardiac arrest - cardiomyopathy - s/p PPM - memory deficits - hypertension - migraine headaches - CKD - constipation\\n\\nMEDICATION ON ADMISSION: Medications at home.

He had done well since his last stent placement in [**4-7**], with no need for nitroglycerin until two weeks prior to admission. He developed chest discomfort with light activity such as climbing one flight of stairs or carrying packages. The chest discomfort was sternal in location, sometimes radiating to his bilateral shoulders, arms, and jaw, [**4-10**] in intensity, and relieved at first within minutes of one nitroglycerin. It felt like his prior angina. He had some associated diaphoresis and nausea, without dyspnea or palpitations. His chest discomfort was not pleuritic in character nor did it feel like heartburn. His nitroglycerin requirement increased over the weeek to the point where he was taking 4 nitroglycerin per episode, leading him to seek medical attention. . In the ED, his vitals were T 97.3, P 52, BP 151/61, RR 16, O2 99% RA. He was given ASA 325mg. He was taken to the cath lab where he was found to have 80% stenosis of the LAD at D1 origin with patent proximal LAD stent, and 70% stenosis of the mid RCA. The procedure was complicated by dissection of the LAD, necessitating placement of DESx2 to the LAD. His D1 was occluded post stenting. . Upon arrival to the floor, the patient initially complained of [**5-11**] chest discomfort that improved with lopressor and IV morphine. . Review of systems is positive for prior stroke, claudications, and night time leg cramps.

She notes she has not been feeling well for several weeks when she noted pain in her back. Initially she was diagnosed with a muscle spasm and given pain mediation. When the pain did not subside she returned for further care and it was noted that she had a rash that appeared to be consistant with shingles. She describes the pain as a band from her abdomen to her back. She was treated with a course of valtrex which she completed and the rash resolved. Her pain persisted, despite treatment with oxycodone and vicodin. Over the last several days, the patient noted a sore throat and increasing oxygen requirement (she typically is on 2L O2 NC at home). She also noted fevers to 102 at home and decreasing O2 sats from 90s to 79% with ambulation. This past weekend (during storm) the patient was exceedingly anxious after the electricity went out. She was trying to find her oxygen tank and felt herself coughing so hard she could barely catch her breath. She denies having any chest pains or dizziness, N/V. She went to an OSH for shortness of breath and back pain. On CXR she found to have multifocal PNA, also notable on labs were a leukocytosis to 24, d-dimer 1.2 (elevated). A CTA was performed however there was dye leak into the left hand and the test was aborted. She was given ceftriaxone and transfered to [**Hospital1 18**]. . On arrival, she was noted to be afebrile with BPs in 120/60s, HR 105, breathing in 20s, O2 sats 80s on 2L. With albuterol and ipratropium nebs and morphine her O2 sat was 90s on 4L and much more comfortable. Noted on exam were a tense compartment in L hand. Plastics was called to evaluate and recommended elevation and frequent pulse checks. CT from the outside hospital shows multifocal PNA, however given lack of contrast cannot evaluate for PE. Notable on her labs in the ED were a leukocytosis with left shift, elevated bicarb. She was started on 750mg levofloxacin IV and 1L IVF was started prior to transfer to the MICU. On admission to ICU, she was afebrile with BP 130/70s, HR 103, 95% 4L O2. . ROS: pertinent positives include headaches (several months), poor appetite, constipation.

In the morning, he went to work but the pain did not subside so he presented to the emergency room. He describes the pain as a somewhat sharp pain \\\"like a stick\\\" but not as sharp as a knife.

He has not had nausea or vomiting except after receiving large doses of pain medication in the ED. He reports no subjective fever and was afebrile on arrival to the ED but then spiked a fever to 102.4 at 6pm. He has not noted any rashes or ecchymoses on any part of his body. He had a cold about a week ago accompanies by some cervical lymphadenopathy but this resolved before his abdominal pain started. He works as a federal prosecutor in an office that is sometimes frequented by prisoners. His only recent travel is to suburban [**State 33174**]. . In the ED, his labs were notable for a WBC of 21.7 and INR of 1.3. Lactate was 1.9. Lytes and LFTs were normal. UA was negative. CXR was unremarkable. Abdominal US showed a 4mm gallbladder polyp but was otherwise unremarkable. D-dimer was negative, but given the patient's continuing symptoms and new fever, a CT torso was done to look for signs of infection.

The etiology of the fall was unclear.  The patient had declined any chest pain, shortness of breath, or syncope.  The patient was admitted to Orthopaedics and taken to the operating room on [**4-19**] for a left bipolar hip arthroplasty.  The immediate postoperative course was complicated by an episode of oxygen desaturation; she was 100% on 30% face mask and 88% on room air.  Later that evening, on [**4-19**], the patient developed diffuse left-sided chest pain, [**8-28**] to [**5-28**] after two sublingual nitroglycerin tablets.  She was sent for a computed tomography angiogram to rule out pulmonary embolism, and cardiac enzymes were cycled to rule out myocardial infarction, and was empirically started on a heparin drip for treatment of pulmonary embolism or acute coronary syndrome.  On the morning of [**4-20**], following the computed tomography angiogram and heparin initiation, the patient was noted to be hypotensive with complaints of chest pain without any change in mental status.  She was bolused a total of 3 liters of normal saline without sustainable improvement in her chest pain.  Of note, the patient had new T wave inversions in V2 through V4 and new 0.5-mm ST depressions in lead II.  She was also complaining of severe left hip pain that was greater than her chest pain during the entire above episode.  The patient was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for management of blood loss anemia secondary to a hemorrhage from surgical wound in the setting of a supratherapeutic anticoagulation after surgery for prophylaxis during pulmonary embolus rule out.  The Medical Intensive Care Unit course was complicated by continued bleeding from the surgical wound requiring a transfusion of a total of 10 units of packed red blood cells, with the last transfusion on [**4-22**].  She was continued on Lovenox until [**4-22**], as Orthopaedics was concerned of an increased risk of pulmonary embolism greater than blood loss. The Lovenox was eventually discontinued.  She was ruled out for a myocardial infarction for a total of three times.

She'd been increasingly dyspneic over the past 2-3d before admit. She'd had no chest discomfort, f/c, or significant cough. In the ED, she was found to have a WBC of 16.8 with 7%bands so was treated with levofloxacin; her o2 sat was 87% on ra in ED but rebound to 99% on 2L-nc. She was found to have 4+ bilateral lower extremity edema. Chest xray in ED was unchanged from prior with densely calcified pleura due to fibrothorax. She had one meausre of O2 sat of 99% on 2 L. Her BNP in the ED was found to be 5455 (last BNP was >6000). She was noted to have elevated WBC of 16 with 7 bands and was given dose of levofloxacin. She was HD stable in the ED however her UOP has been none to minimal. She was given dose of dexamethasone in the ED for concern of adrenal insufficiency. . She was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] where she received ceftriaxone and azithromycin and remained stable throughout the day, so was sent to the floor.

At that admission patient was noted to have B/L LE edema with negative LENI and felt edema secondary to low albumin. . She was doing well on the wards until [**4-2**] when she began to be hypothermic. Though she had been hypothermic in the ICU with temperatures in the 95 range, she was more so on the floor with temps in the 93 axillary range with as low as 91. The team changed her abx from levoquin to vanc/zosyn for broader coverage on [**4-2**]. She was also given increased lasix on [**4-2**] (recieved 10 PO and 20 IV at noon). Attempts to warm her were unsuccessful. Approximately 9:30 PM on [**4-2**], she began to become hypotensive as well with systolics in the 70's.

He noticed that on standing, he lost peripheral vision in the right eye; this has recurred throughout the week.  He called his PCP who thought these episodes were migraines (though the patient has never had them - his headache history includes only a post-LP headache).

He initially developed a \\\"pimple\\\" on his left inner thigh one week prior to admit.  He popped it and it drained a small amount of pus.  It recurred one day later and he popped it again.  It occured the next day but larger and he felt that it was moving into his leg.  He assumed it was a boil and started putting warm compresses on it.  The redness, swelling and pain slowly spread in his inner thigh, into the inguinal region and into his left gluteal region.  He was also having fevers at home to 101.  He presented to the ED on [**5-15**] and was admitted for cellulits.

By the time of his arrival to the floor during that admission his mental status changes had essentially resolved and his headache was thought consistent with chronic headache he has had for at least a month.  He had a CT scan during that admission, which was stable. . Today, Mr [**Known lastname 84008**] neuro-oncologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**] got a call from [**Hospital **] [**Hospital **] Rehab Center reporting confusion.  Apparently the patient was forgetting the details of his recent hospitalization and confused as to where he was and where he had been.  Per his wife, he has not participated in rehab since his recent admission on [**7-13**] and has been consistently confused at rehab. He also reported headache, which per the patient was unchanged from what he has been dealing with for months.  This is bifrontal and throbbing in character.  It has not improved with treatment for sinusitis with fluticasone.  The patient also reports he is unsure of the details of his confusion and feels like he has been progressively improving.  Further details are not available at this time.  The physician at rehab did not feel comfortable managing the patient so he was transferred in to [**Hospital1 18**].  In the ED initial VS were T 97.3, P 96, BP 126/85, RR 18, O2 92% RA.  He complained of chronic headache but had no other complaints  He had a CT head, which was stable as well as CXR and UA.  His UA showed very mild pyuria and thus he received PO ciprofloxacin *1.  He was evaluated by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**] in the ED who thought he appeared stable from his previous baseline and was ready to discharge him back to rehab but when the patient's wife reported more chronically altered mental status a decision was made to admit him for further work-up. . On the floor the patient cannot remember why he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] but confabulates a story about needing to be brought here to have a bowel movement (likely due to apparently asking to defecate in the ambulance and being told he had to wait to get to [**Hospital Ward Name **]).

She went to went to planned parenthood for the 2 day procedure; during second day had desaturation to 78% and abdominal pain, and was sent to [**Hospital1 **] for evaluation.  There she was found to have a Hct of 24 and SBPs in the 70's. She was also noted to have ?SVT to the 150's and was given metoprolol and adenosine and was eventually electrically cardioverted to sinus rhythm. She was given 2 unit PRBCs and 7 L IVF, and also got FFP. She underwent a CTA which showed no PE and an abdominal CT with no hemorrhage. Prior to this presentation in the OSH ED, she had been experience milder abdominal pain for the past two weeks and had an episode of BRBPR the day prior to presentation. . In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED she had SBPs in the 90s. She was given an additional unit of PRBC, 2 units FFP, and rhogham. Gynecology evaluated her and recommended starting zosyn and doxycycline. She had a left IJ placed and was briefly on neo for pressure support. On vaginal exam she was noted to have small clots. Rectal showed trace guaiac stool. Of note she has recently beeing taking large amounts of ibuprofen for pain. She was started on an IV PPI. . She was initially in respiratory distress on arrival to the MICU (thought to be due to flash pulmonary edema from the IVF) and was given lasix. In the MICU her Hcts remained stable with no further need for transfusion. Her acute anemia was thought to be a combination of blood loss from her recent abortion and a slow GI bleed possibly from NSAID-induced gastritis. She has had significant anxiety and ?PTSD and psychiatry has been following and making recommendations. She continues to have abdominal pain and is on a dilaudid PCA. Social work is also following. GI was consulted and are planning possible EGD/colonoscopy for Tuesday (will likely need MAC) versus watchful waiting. . Additionally she had been placed on prednisone by her pulmonologist (to be tapered). She was on 60 mg prior to admission and has been tapered to 40 mg. . MICU attempted to call her out [**4-8**] but when the team evaluated her she was found to have HR in the 150's with significant anxiety. ? SVT. Sinus massage was attempted, but she was so shaky, it was difficult to do. When she slowed down (when her anxiety started to be controled), the rhythm looked like sinus tach, not SVT, and she was kept in the ICU for 1 more night. . Patient continues to have abdominal pain, worst on the L, most TTP over the CVA on the L. The abdominal pain has been requiring a dilaudid PCA; ICU team felt she may have nonobstructive nephrolithiasis vs an ovarian cyst but all imaging is with contrast, so unclear.  GYN are following and does not think there is any retained products but thinks may have had endometritis so have continued course of abx, currently zosyn and doxycycline.  .

(history obtained from notes/patient's wife) The patient was a passenger in his car and was doing errands with his wife.  At one point she turned to him and thought he looked grey.  He complained of severe nausea and she pulled over to the side of the road.  She then noted a right facial droop and he appeared to be having trouble with his right arm, possibly his right leg.  As his wife is [**Name8 (MD) **] RN she thought he may be having a stroke and called EMS who picked him up and transported him to [**Hospital3 26615**].  At AJ he was noted to be significantly hypertensive, with multiple BPs at 260/120s.  He had a head CT and was noted to have a left sided pontine hemorrhage.  At the time according to notes he was awake and could respond to commands, was not using his right arm and right leg, and had a right facial droop.  He could respond to commands with his left side.  He was given labetalol for his BP and then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further eval.  Here he was initially seen by the ED and neurosurgery team.  On initial exam they neurosurgeons felt he was able to say his name, had slurred speech, a right facial droop, they only elicited upgaze.  He was able to follow commands with his left arm/leg, and had no movement at the right.  He apparently was becoming more sleepy as the interview progressed and he was sent to the CT scanner.  The CT demonstrated a stable bleed, with slightly more edema than on the prior scan.  On return from the scanner the patient was even more somnolent and he was intubated and sedated out of concern for protecting his airway.  Neurosurgery at this point recommended no surgical intervention and neurology was called to evaluate the patient.  Of note per his wife the patient has long standing hypertension however as he has been unemployed for some time and does not have health insurance.  He has not taken any of his antihypertensive medications for many months now.

Per the patient's son, the patient has been having difficulties for the past nine weeks, with delerium that finally resolved after adding phosphate binders, correcting lyte (hypercalcemia, hyperpphos) abnormalities, and d/c'ing sedating medications.  Per rehab records, she recently had recurrent C diff, and was treated with Zosyn for PNA with cxs + for Providencia stuartii, Psuedomonas, and Citrobacter.  She appeared to recover when she was noted about 1 week prior to admission be increasingly hypotensive with altered mental status.  She had blood and C diff cxs from [**6-11**] which were negative.  Sputum cultures again grew Citrobacter and Pseudomonas.  She was started on Levaquin for Citrobacter (Pseudomonas was presumed to be a colonizer) but she was noted to have worsening resp status with increasingly purulent sputum.  On [**6-15**] her antibiotics were changed to Tobramycin and Cefepime.  Her WBC has continued to rise, she had an episode of atrial fibrillation, and then the above mentioned episodes at HD. . In the ED, Patient's blood pressures were initially in the 90's - 100's and the patient's mental status was at baseline per her son.  [**Name (NI) **] [**Name2 (NI) **] count returned at 20.1 and her CXR came back as having BL infiltrates concerning for multifocal PNA vs aspiration.  She then began to drop her pressures into the 60's systolic.  A code sepsis was called.  She received 2 liters of fluid and was started on peripheral levophed.  A central lines was placed and her initial CVP was 13 and her lactate was 1.5. She appeared to be having significant oral secretions and de-satting down to the 80's so she was placed on the ventilator.  She was started on Vancomycin, Zosyn, Azithromycin and admitted to MICU for further work-up and management. . Per her son, at baseline she is able to hold a coherent conversation although she has some chronic deficits from her previous CVA's including frequent altered mental status with infections or lyte abnormalities, finding it difficult to explain where her pain is in her body, and being easily overstimulated (lights, sounds.)  She had some diarrhea at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab today, and again in the ED, and one episode of vomiting this AM.

Please see [**Hospital 1263**] Hospital discharge summary for further details of his initial presentation and hospital course there.  In brief, he presented to [**Hospital 1263**] Hospital [**2132-11-8**] complaining of shortness of breath for two days following a recent upper respiratory tract infection two weeks prior to admission.  On admission he was tachypneic to the 40s, hypoxic to 93% on 100% nonrebreather, tachycardiac to 180 and hypotensive.  Labs were notable for a white blood count of 5 with 49% neutrophils and 40% bands.  Chest x-ray revealed left lower lobe and possibly right lower lobe infiltrates. Blood cultures grew out six out of six bottles with Streptococcus pneumoniae.  He was begun empirically on Unasyn and the Azithromycin which was subsequently switched to Vancomycin when an organism was identified.  On [**11-11**], he was switched to Penicillin when the organism was found to be pansensitive.  Despite therapy, he continued to spike fevers to 101 to 102 on a daily basis despite subsequent cultures being negative.  He had an exhaustive workup for alternative etiology of his persistent fevers including right upper quadrant ultrasound which was negative for cholecystitis, lower extremity noninvasives which were negative for deep vein thrombosis, chest computerized tomography scan which was negative for empyema.  An echocardiogram was negative for endocarditis.  He did have a head computerized axial tomography scan which revealed sinusitis.  Gram stain and cultures of sputum and nasal swabs revealed Pseudomonas aeruginosa and so Levofloxacin was added to his regimen.  On [**11-19**], per Infectious Disease consult recommendation, Penicillin and Levofloxacin were discontinued and he was switched to Ceftazidime and Gentamicin to treat his pneumococcal pneumonia and Pseudomonas sinusitis.  On the day of transfer, he was also started on empirically on Flagyl and p.o. Vancomycin for oppression of Clostridium difficile, however, Clostridium difficile toxin subsequently returned negative.  Despite all of these treatments, he continued to spike fevers on a daily basis.  His hospital course at [**Doctor Last Name 1263**] was also notable for respiratory failure.  He was intubated on admission for hypoxic respiratory failure which was felt to be due to his pneumonia, presumably from pneumococcus, although this organism was never cultured from his sputum, only from his blood.  It is not clear whether he was attempted to be weaned from the ventilator, but he required persistent sedation, due to tachypnea to the 50s and desaturation whenever attempts at weaning sedation were made.  His tachycardia and hypotension on admission was felt likely due to sepsis.  His hemodynamics stabilized with fluids, Dopamine, and antibiotics by hospital day #3 and he was able to be weaned off of Dopamine at that time.  He ruled out for a myocardial infarction and echocardiogram [**11-17**] revealed ejection fraction of 75% with mild left ventricular hypokinesis.

Cefpodoxime 200 mg twice daily was started. Despite this intervention, he remained febrile, and he began having yellow drainage from his ulcer.  He was therefore brought to the ED on [**8-10**].  There, he was hypotensive (80s/60s).  Blood and urine cultures were drawn, dexamethasone was given, empiric vanc, levoflox, and flagyl were started, and 3.6 liters of fluid were infused.  He was admitted to the ICU.  On further review of systems, the patient reports a history of progressive night sweats with chills over the past 5-6 months. He's also had a cough productive of increasing amounts of white sputum for the two months PTA.  He has limited sensation but has felt increased pain in his sacral decub recently.  His left-sided, burning chest pain, right-sided abdominal pain, and R>L shoulder pain all started with the onset of his paresis and have progressed steadily since then.  Blood pressure promptly returned to the range of the patient's relatively low baseline with early goal directed therapy.  He was admitted to the ICU under the sepsis protocol but required ICU-level care for less than 48 hours.  Fevers are most likely due to sacral osteomyelitis.  Bone scan non-diagnostic, but suggestive of osteomyelitis.  MRI likely not possible due to IVC filter; would confirm this with radiology. Since we can probe to bone on physical exam, then the diagnosis becomes increasingly likely.  Referred to orthopedics consult for bone biopsy and discussion of possible ulcer debridement. Vancomycin and ciprofloxacin were started pending biopsy. Continue aggressive wound care.  3. Pulmonary Embolism: Goal INR [**3-14**].  Warfarin currently being held.

Her initial presentation dates back to [**2186**] where she initially presented with worsening shortness of breath and cough.  At that time, she was misdiagnosed as asthma and she was resistant to all inhaled medication.  Her symptoms progressed to the point that further workup was initiated in [**2189**]/[**2190**] including PFTs and CT scan of the chest.  Meanwhile, the patient was also experiencing classical symptoms of relapsing polychondritis, including recurrent ear pain and transformation in the shape of her nose to a saddle nose and hoarseness of her voice.  In [**2190**], based on those symptoms and appearance for CAT scan, bronchoscopy was performed, which revealed severe tracheobronchomalacia and follow up airways and two Polyflex stents were placed in the trachea for central airway stabilization.  Since that time, the patient's breathing improved; however, she has been having a problem with recurrent bronchitis and recurrent pseudomonas pulmonary infection requiring multiple antibiotic courses.  Most recently, the patient was admitted to hospital in [**Location (un) 36413**] for respiratory distress, stridor.

He had initially detected a lump on the anterior surface of his right lower extremity in [**2126-10-25**].  He was sent for an ultrasound, which revealed a solid area of 2.6 by 1.0 cm that was nontender to touch.  He did not seek any further evaluation for this until [**2127-8-25**] when he began to awaken in the night with pain in the area of the lump.  He then received an MRI scan, which noted to be a slightly increased interval in size to 3 cm and he was at this point referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for orthopedic evaluation.  He was seen on [**2127-10-13**] at which time Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] received the CT scans that were performed on [**2127-10-14**] as well as an MRI and a bone scan and plain films.  The bone scan did show some mild increase uptake in the right tibia and the distal left femur.  The plain film of the left distal femur showed evidence of an enchondroma.  A CT and MRI were significant for a periosteal reaction in the bone adjacent to the small subcutaneous mass of low signal abnormality, which did enhance diffusely and measured approximately 6 to 7 cm. At this point biopsy was recommended.  He was taken to the Operating Room by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2127-11-17**] for an incisional biopsy.  Final pathology report indicated a malignant spindle cell neoplasm consistent with a leiomyosarcoma.  The tumor was moderate cellular with moderate cytologic atypia and rare mitosis.  Flow cytometry revealed poly clonality to the B cells and mature lineage antigens from B cells and T cells indicating no evidence for a hematologic origin for this malignancy.  The surgical plan of treatment was to take the patient to the Operating Room for wide local excision of his leiomyosarcoma of the right tibia followed by immediate reconstruction by the Plastic Surgery Service with a gracilis free flap and split thickness skin graft to cover the wound.\\n\\nMEDICAL HISTORY: \\n\\nMEDICATION ON ADMISSION: \\n\\nALLERGIES: \\n\\nPHYSICAL EXAM: \\n\\nFAMILY HISTORY: \\n\\nSOCIAL HISTORY: \",\n",

This was though possibly to be a neoplasm, which might have explained a neuropathy that the patient had which had defied workup with the consideration that it might be a perineoplastic phenomenon.  On [**2176-8-5**], the patient had a fine needle aspiration of the nodule, which eventually showed a solid 3.4 x 2.2 x 1.9 cm mass, not a multinodular goiter but simply a hyperplastic nodule.  However, the patient had a resultant mediastinal hematoma with respiratory distress which was first noticed at home post procedure.  The patient returned to the [**Hospital1 **] emergency room and was intubated in the emergency room for airway protection.  A CT scan showed that she had airway stenosis distal to the endotracheal tube, so she was sent to the operating room for mediastinal exploration.

In [**2173-10-18**], she suffered a syncopal episode and presented to [**Hospital2 **] [**Hospital3 6783**] Hospital where evaluation documented critical aortic stenosis by both catheterization as well as echocardiography.  Coronary angiography at that time demonstrated an occluded proximal LAD, moderate diffuse disease in the LCx, and an occluded RCA.  There was a patent SVG to the right coronary and a patent SVG tot he LAD. Quantitation of her aortic stenosis yielded a mean transvalvular gradient of 46 mmHg and a valve area of 0.6 by Fick estimate. At that time, the patient reportedly had a significantly elevated pulmonary arterial pressure of systolic of 115mmHg, though no wedge pressure was available in the report. She was evaluated by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 50180**] of Cardiothoracic Surgery at [**Hospital2 **] [**Hospital3 6783**] and deemed to be prohibitively high-risk candidate for traditional aortic valve surgery.

He was discharged to a rehabilitation center in [**State 108**].  He was readmitted [**2154-2-22**] for subacute renal failure with creatinine increase to 11.8 and was dialyzed and discharged with an improving creatinine.  The patient's current symptoms consist of left upper quadrant abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and weakness.  The course of events began two days prior to presentation when he had approximately six fried clams while on [**Location (un) **].  Within approximately one hour he began having nausea and vomiting of nonbloody material.  Diarrhea began within about five hours, which was copious, watery and nonbloody.  He also had left sided abdominal pain without radiation.  One day prior to presentation he developed fever and chills with increasing weakness and was advised by his primary care physician to come to the Emergency Department.  In the Emergency Department he was noted to have a blood glucose of 659 and he reported not taking insulin over the last two days.  He was also noted to have an elevated creatinine to 4.2.  While in the Emergency Department he became progressively weaker and blood pressure dropped to the 70s systolic.  He was given a fluid challenge, which failed to increase blood pressure or urine output so he was started on Dopamine with maintenance systolic blood pressure in the 100s.  He was empirically given Levaquin and Flagyl for an unknown infectious etiology.  CT scan of the abdomen was performed while in the Emergency Department, which showed multiple abnormalities of the pancrease with calcifications in head, hypodense lesion within the body consistent with pseudocyst versus neoplasm.  He was also noted to have left renal stone in pelvis with right renal stone and proximal ureter causing hydronephrosis and perinephric stranding.  He was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for hemodynamic monitoring, diabetic ketoacidosis, possible urosepsis secondary to nephrolithiasis.\\n\\nMEDICAL HISTORY: 1.  Type 2 diabetes.  2.
