Brief Hospital Course: Briefly, this is a yo male with h/o mild mental retardation, HTN, & DM, who presented to with GI complaints and, during evaluation of a possible GI illness, aspirated on CT contrast material. He subsequently developed respiratory failure and was found to have an inferior MI, for which he was transferred to the CCU. . . CV: Shortly after admission, the pt was found to have an IMI; however, based on the history, ECG & cardiac enzymes the timing of the pt's MI was unclear, possibly having occured >- hours prior. Thus, the patient was not re-vascularized at that time. Medical management for his MI was provided with heparin gtt, aspirin, plavix, and atorvastatin. (Of note, the atorvastatin was later discontinued because of increasingly elevated LFTs while on it. Plans for a diagnostic cardiac catheterization were started. However, because of deterioration in the patient's condition, this procedure was delayed until . The pt underwent a left and right heart catheterization on , which revealed vessel coronary artery disease involving the left anterior descending, left circumflex, and right coronary artery. Because of the patient's condition (he was febrile and volume overloaded, CT surgery felt that the risk of performing CABG at that time was too high. Thus, the pt underwent stenting (with drug eluting stents of the presumed culprit vessel, the left circumflex. Plans for stenting of the LAD or CABG within one week of the cath were made. Results from the right heart catheterization revealed a mixed picture: elements of cardiogenic and septic shock. . The patient showed improvement after PTCI and stenting of the left circumflex: his hemodynamics improved as did his apparent cardiac function. He tolerated aggresive diuresis, and began to show signs of improved respiratory function. He was extubated, and transferred to the floor. On , he underwent CABG. . Respiratory failure: The patient developed hypoxic respiratory failure presumably secondary to aspiration of contrast material. Chest CT revealed moderate bilateral pleural effusions and patchy opacities within the lower lobes and the right upper lobe. He was treated for presumed aspiration pneumonia with vancomycin and Zosyn for days. During this time, he pt failed extubation twice (once was a self-extubation. After stenting of his left circ, he began to show signs of respiratory improvement. With the aid of aggresive diuresis, the patient was able to be slowly weaned off the ventilator. Given his high-risk for re-intubation, steps were made to optimize his condition before extubating. He underwent over hours of minimal support on pressue support ventilation, before successful extubation. . PNA/? sepsis: the patient was treated for presumed aspiration pneumonia initially with Levofloxacin and flagyl. These were discontinued and vancomycin and Zosyn were started. A total of days of Vanco & Zosyn were given. Despite anti-biotic therapy, he continued to spike fevers and have an elevated white count. His hemodynamic measurements also showed evidence of sepsis. was consulted and the patient underwent a thorough work-up for a source of infection. Pan-cultures were negative. Chest CT was suggestive of PNA, for which therapy was continued. The pt's left sided pleural effusion was tapped. The results were negative. Subsequent bronchoscopy was performed and no evidence of pneumonia or other pathologies were found. Abdominal CT failed to reveal any evidence of abscess or infection. Thus, after a near complete course of antibiotic therapy for PNA, antibiotics were discontinued, since no other localizing source could be found. The patient's fever subsequently abated. . Renal Failure: pt had acute renal failure, which was thought to be pre-renal in origin. This resolved as his hemodynamics improved following stenting & diuresis. . Anemia: pt was found to be anemic during his acute illness. His RBC indices were normal. No bleeding source was found. He was did require transfusion. . Diabetes: treated with RISS. . FEN: while intubated tube feeds were given. Following extubation, the pt was noted to be coughing while taking PO food/drink. He underwent a swallowing video study that revealed mild-moderate dysphagia. Speech & swallow recommended resuming tube feeds while pt was recovering and repeat swallowing evaluation upon stabilization. . DM: on sliding scale insulin. Monitor sugars. . Code Status: Full . Social: prior to undergoing CABG, pt made his sister health care proxy. The pt was evaluated by psychiatry prior to CABG to evaluate his ability to consent for surgery. They felt that he understood the risks & benefits adequately & could make the decision himself. Taken to the OR on / for CAG After cabg, he was transferred to CSRU in stable condition on epinephrine, neosynephrine, insulin, milrinone, and propofol drips. Insulin drip off on POD . Epinephrine and propofol weaned off on POD and extubated. Beta blockade started and transfused one unit PRBCs for hct .Milrinine weaned off on POD and chest tubes removed. On POD and gentle diuresis begun, continued on abx for sputum production, and pacing wires removed. Transferred to the floor to begin increasing his activity level.Dobhoff tube placed for feeding. Social worker involved in his discharge planning. Repeat bedside and video swallowing eval done on POD with recommendations to crush all pills and no thin liquids (nectar -thick only. Speech therapy was strongly recommended for his rehab. He had remained hemodynamically stable, and is ready for discharge to rehab to progress with physical therapy, and speech/swallowing therapy.

He initially was admitted to an OSH with respiratory failure appromixately weeks prior to admission to , thought to be secondary to a viral illness, during which time he was sucessfully intubated and extubated, and, upon recovery, was transferred to a rehab facility. At the rehab, he was involved in a wheelchair accident that resulted in a right tibial fracture, for which he was re-admitted to the OSH and underwent a successful ORIF. However, post-operatively he developed hypercarbic respiratory failure; he was unable to be intubated due to a difficult airway so underwent a nasotracheal intubation. He was then transferred to for tracheostomy. On admission, he was afebrile and hemodynamically stable but was found to have severe musculoskeletal deformities from his RA.

Brief Hospital Course: y/o male with severe transferred from outside hospital for tracheostomy and found to have lower extremity necrosis and infection. Mr. initially had a succesfuly tracheostomy placement. Given the appearance of his legs, especially the right side, orthopedic, podiatric, and wound consults were called. As he began growing out pseudomonas, he was started on ciprofloxacin and gentamicin, given the sensitivities. He began to develop signs of sepsis, with decreasing blood pressure, tachycardia, and increasing WBC. Levophed was started to support his blood pressure. In discussions with orthopedics, the patient, and his family, it was decided that as his right lower extremity was the likely nidus of infection, anputation was indicated. He went to the OR and had a succesful right AKA. Upon returing, however, he showed little clinical improvement, remaining pressor depedent. He also developed new onset afib with rapid ventricular response; to investigate the cause, he had full electrolytes drawn, and ecg was checked, he was ruled-out for MI, and had a CTA to evaluate for pulmonary embolus, all of which was negative. He was rate controlled with intermittent diltiazem. However, Mr. overall clinical picture continued to deteriorate, with increasing pressor requirements and declining mental status. His blood cultures grew out a highly resistant E. faecium. A family discussion was held, and they felt that given his baseline severe chronic illness, his quality of life, even if an aggressive course of treatment for his acute illness was successful, would remain quite poor. Based on this discussion, support was withdrawn, Mr. was made comfortable, and he died shortly therafter.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a year old Caucasian woman with a past medical history significant for pneumonia and diverticulitis, who, on the evening of admission, was at home and was noted by her husband to call out in pain, complaining of the acute onset of a headache. Soon thereafter she was noted to lose consciousness and was unresponsive. Paramedics were called to the scene. Upon arrival of paramedics, patient was noted to have a weak and thready pulse and CPR was administered and patient was intubated. Patient was transported to for evaluation. At head CT was performed which showed significant subarachnoid hemorrhage in the suprasellar cistern, the perimesencephalic cisterns as well as intraventricular hemorrhage in the frontal horns and within the third ventricle. Diffuse cerebral edema was also noted. Patient was then transported to for further care. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Pneumonia. Diverticulitis. Dehydration. MEDICATIONS: None. ALLERGIES: Aspirin intolerance. SOCIAL HISTORY: Lives with husband. Smoking status unknown. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Temperature . degrees, blood pressure to systolic over to diastolic, heart rate to . Patient was intubated, % FIO. On general examination, thin, Caucasian woman laying in bed, intubated, unresponsive. HEENT: no evidence of head trauma. Pupils fixed, dilated, approximately mm midposition. Oropharynx clear. Heart had regular rhythm and was tachycardiac without murmurs, gallops or rubs. Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen was nontender, nondistended with decreased bowel sounds throughout. Extremities had good dorsalis pedis pulses as well as good radial pulses bilaterally. There was no cyanosis, clubbing or edema. On neurological examination she was unresponsive to noxious stimuli. Pupils were fixed and dilated. She had no gag or cough reflexes. Corneal reflex was absent. Ocular cephalics showed no evidence of vestibular function. .................... were performed which showed no nystagmus. Reflexes were + throughout symmetrically. Musculoskeletal examination showed no evidence of trauma, ecchymosis or abrasions. LABORATORY DATA: EKG showed normal intervals, normal axis with a mildly prolonged QT interval and mild ST elevations in , aVL, V and V through V. White blood count was ., hematocrit ., platelets . CK was . Sodium , potassium ., chloride , bicarb , BUN , creatinine ., glucose . Urinalysis showed to red blood cells, few bacteria. ABG showed pH of ., PCO , PO . HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit. Cardiology was consulted initially because of concern over ST elevations apparent on her admission EKG. Cardiology consult felt that the diffuse nonspecific changes were most likely due to cerebral catastrophe. Neurosurgery was also consulted and felt that patient was clearly without brainstem reflexes with an extremely poor prognosis. The neurosurgery service did not recommend further intervention. Patient was rewarmed to a temperature of degrees. Central access was obtained through the left femoral vein. The right femoral vein was accessed with an arterial catheter for continuous blood pressure monitoring. Patient continued to have absent brainstem reflexes even after rewarming and volume resuscitation. Patient then began to exhibit increasing metabolic acidosis by her arterial blood gas and this precluded the diagnosis of brain death. She was discussed with the transplant team coordinator who was in the intensive care unit and evaluated the patient. It was felt that in the setting of worsening metabolic acidosis, there was little benefit to be gained through further attempts to salvage the organs for harvest. The situation was discussed with the family in detail and the family was aware of the prognosis. Family returned in the morning and patient's ventilatory support was removed and pressors were stopped. Patient expired quickly after removal of the endotracheal tube. The patient was pronounced dead at : a.m. on . The medical examiner was notified and declined autopsy. , M.D. : MEDQUIST D: : T: : : cc:\",\n",

       "   \"text_a\": \": : Service: CSU HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This -year-old female was admitted from Hospital after cardiac catheterization on . Prior to the angiogram, the patient reportedly had chest pain relieved by sublingual nitroglycerin. She also reported shortness of breath after one block and climbing any stairs. Cardiac catheterization showed three-vessel disease. The patient was placed on heparin drip and transferred to . The patient also had a history of transient ischemic attack with no residual and was placed on Coumadin prior to her admission. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Hypertension. Coronary artery disease. Hypothyroidism. Atrial fibrillation. History of transient ischemic attack. Status post cholecystectomy. Status post pacemaker insertion. Status post thyroidectomy. Status post left total hip replacement, . MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Aspirin, Coumadin, Lopressor mg p.o. b.i.d., Norvasc, Prilosec, Synthroid mcg p.o. once daily, Imdur mg p.o. once daily, Zestril mg once daily. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: She was in atrial fibrillation with a heart rate of , saturation of percent on three liters nasal cannula, blood pressure / with a respiratory rate of . She was alert and oriented times three but was a fairly poor historian. Her lungs were clear bilaterally. Heart was irregularly irregular. Abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended. She had two plus bilateral radial pulses, two plus femoral pulse on the left. Her right femoral artery had an A-line in place. Dorsalis pedis on the left was palpable and on the right was biphasic. LABORATORY DATA: Cardiac catheterization showed a left main percent lesion, a mid left anterior descending coronary artery lesion of percent and totally occluded right coronary artery and a ramus lesion of percent. Preoperative labs are as follows: Sodium , potassium ., chloride , bicarbonate , BUN , creatinine . with a blood sugar of , hematocrit ., PTT .. HOSPITAL COURSE: Cardiac echocardiogram and carotid ultrasounds were also ordered. The patient did remain on the Medical service for a number of issues prior to surgery, which did not take place until . The first issue that had to be addressed was the patient became febrile and white blood cell count rose slightly. The patient was also consulted by the Infectious Disease service as they looked for a possible source of the fevers. The patient was also followed by the Cardiology fellow. Her sheaths were pulled as it was determined that she would not be going to surgery right away. The patient was transferred into the Coronary Care Unit after she was seen on admission. She was also started on a nitroglycerin drip. This helped bring her blood pressures down. On arrival, her blood pressure rose to /. Nitroglycerin drip helped to improve her blood pressure to the s systolic. The patient did not have any chest pain or shortness of breath at the time. She continued in atrial fibrillation and remained on an intravenous heparin drip as well as receiving her beta blocker. She was seen by Dr. on who also quoted her significant mortality of approximately percent based on her age and her other relative risk factors. She did remain afebrile on with a normal white count. The plan was to wait until she was afebrile, at least hours. Additionally, the patient had some postoperative bleeding from her right groin site and required additional compression to avoid hematoma. Heparin was held. The patient had a new bruit over the femoral artery with decreasing blood pressures. Prior to the groin bleeding, blood pressures systolic were / and dropped to /. CT scan was ordered to rule out also a retroperitoneal bleed. The patient was given an intravenous fluid bolus and was followed on the Cardiology service and Dr. , cardiologist, was also notified. Given her fever and her groin bleed, the decision was made to postpone her surgery. The following day, surgery was rescheduled but the patient that night spiked a temperature to . and surgery was again postponed. The patient was also seen by the Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery service preoperatively to rule out a dental infection. Please refer to their consult note. White count did rise on preoperatively to . and then dropped to .. Blood cultures were pending. At that time, we renewed our request that cardiac surgery not be performed on the patient until she remained afebrile for hours with a normal white count. Carotid ultrasounds were performed on , which showed a - percent right internal carotid artery stenosis and a - percent left internal carotid artery stenosis. Please refer to the final report. A dental consult also revealed the patient had a retained root of a tooth which should probably be removed before surgery but it was unlikely to be the source of her fever. Their recommendations were followed in terms of specific mouthwash for the patient to use. They recommended the patient follow-up with her dentist or an OMFS as an outpatient to have the root removed after surgery. The patient was also seen by the Infectious Disease consult team who recommended a full body scan for the patient's chest, abdomen and pelvis to look for any sources of her fever. The patient was also tested for tuberculosis. The patient was also followed everyday by Dr. of Cardiology, her attending cardiologist. Fever workup continued on . Dental and Infectious Disease consults were noted and appreciated. H. pylori testing was sent off also. On , the patient's right groin hematoma was approximately walnut sized with occasional droplets of bright red blood oozing. Mini pressure dressing continued to be applied with no further bleeding later in the day. The patient was maintained on bedrest at the time and did have pedal pulses. The patient was cleared for surgery on . On , the patient underwent coronary artery bypass grafting times four by Dr. with the left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending coronary artery, a vein graft to the posterior descending coronary artery, a vein graft to the diagonal and vein graft to the ramus. The patient was transferred to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit AV paced in stable condition on a Neo- Synephrine drip at . mcg/kg/min and propofol drip at mcg/kg/min. Prior to surgery, urine cultures, blood cultures and RPR were all negative on the patient. Abdominal scans did not reveal anything other than an incidental infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm. Please refer to the Vascular Surgery consult. Chest CT showed some pulmonary nodules as read by Radiology. Please refer to the final report. Recommendation was made that the patient get outpatient follow-up after discharge post bypass surgery to follow-up on the nodules. The patient was also seen by Electrophysiology service to interrogate her pacemaker postoperatively. Their impression was that the patient needed a new pacemaker generator before discharge. Epicardial pacing wires remained in place. On postoperative day one, the patient remained on an insulin drip at two units per hour. Blood pressure /. Hemodynamically stable in sinus rhythm at . She remained on the ventilator. Postoperative labs were as follows: White blood cell count ., hematocrit ., platelet count ,, sodium , chloride , bicarbonate , BUN , creatinine . with a blood sugar of . The patient continued on perioperative antibiotics. The patient was also seen by the Case Management team. After extubation on , it was noted that the patient's baseline speech was slightly garbled at times. The patient was oriented though and following all commands and moving all four extremities. The patient was in atrial flutter with the pacer responding appropriately and periods of normal sinus rhythm. Beta blockage was restarted with Lopressor. The patient's saturation was - percent on three liters nasal cannula. Her lungs were clear. Chest tubes remained in place. On postoperative day two, the patient received two units of packed red blood cells which brought her hematocrit up to . Her heart was regular in rate and rhythm. Her chest tubes remained in place. She had decreased breath sounds bilaterally. She had one plus peripheral edema. Her incisions were unremarkable. She was back in atrial fibrillation. The patient was restarted on her Coumadin of mg dose that evening and started on Captopril. Chest tubes were pulled. Lasix diuresis was begun and the patient was transferred out to the floor. On postoperative day three, pacing wires had also been discontinued. The patient continued on Coumadin mg dose that evening. Hematocrit rose slightly to .. Captopril was increased to . twice a day. Creatinine remained stable at . with a potassium of .. The patient remained V-paced under her own pacemaker at . Incisions were clean, dry and intact. She had a trace of pedal edema. She was seen again by the Electrophysiology service on and recommended keeping the patient NPO that day so that she could have her generator changed the following morning as soon as she received Infectious Disease clearance. She also continued to work with the physical therapist. Occasionally, the patient was slightly confused to time of day, asking some odd questions. She was also noted to be very hard of hearing. She continued in atrial flutter with underlying occasional runs of supraventricular tachycardia. Electrolytes were all repleted as needed. On , the patient was taken back to the Catheterization Laboratory for a pacemaker generator change by the Electrophysiology service and Dr. . The following day, the patient was transferred out of the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit. The patient was a little bit confused and trying to get up. A sitter was requested for the patient. Exam was unremarkable. Incisions were clean, dry and intact. The patient had no complaints of pain at that time. On postoperative day six, the patient continued to have a little bit of confusion and restlessness the evening prior after her pacemaker change. This did require a sitter. She was much clearer in the morning. She continued on vancomycin perioperative antibiotics additionally to cover her pacemaker change. She had decreased breath sounds bilaterally. She had a nonfocal exam. Extremities were warm with one plus peripheral edema. Incisions were clean, dry and intact. The patient was encouraged to be more mobile with physical therapy but was stable. Her Foley was removed and she continued on her Coumadin dosing for atrial fibrillation. She continued to work with the physical therapist. It was determined the patient would probably require discharge to rehabilitation as she was still requiring a sitter one to one. The patient needed to be oriented appropriately p.r.n. On , the patient had a five-beat run of ventricular tachycardia which resolved spontaneously. The following day, the patient was much more alert and oriented. The one to one sitter was discontinued. She had no confusion noted and was responding appropriately. On postoperative day five, discharge planning was begun and rehabilitation screens were also accomplished to allow the patient to go to an outside facility, to continue work with Physical Therapy and her general overall strength given her age. The patient continued to make rapid improvement and the plan was then changed to allow her for the possibility of going home on with the possibility of VNA services. The patient's sister had agreed to stay with the patient during the day but was unclear as to who was going to stay with the patient at night but to make sure that the patient was safe in the evenings this was all re-evaluated by the case manager. On postoperative day six, the patient was back in sinus rhythm with occasionally V-paced beats, blood pressure of /, hemodynamically stable. She had some scattered rhonchi bilaterally and her plan for discharge was again delayed as her INR only rose to ., well below therapeutic range. On postoperative day eight, we continued to await the rise in her INR. Her exam was unremarkable and she was remaining hemodynamically stable with saturation of percent on room air. She continued to progress and was using her rolling walker without any difficulty. She was moving out of bed and getting out of bed to bathroom by herself, also without any difficulty. The patient was discharge to home on with instructions for the VNA to draw blood for INR levels and to call the results to the patient's primary care physician. patient was also instructed to follow-up with her local cardiologist, Dr. , in approximately - days after discharge; to follow-up with her primary care physician, . , for an appointment in days post discharge but Dr. is also responsible for following the patient's Coumadin dosing and INR, phone number . The patient was also instructed to follow-up with Dr. , her surgeon, in the office in approximately three weeks post discharge for her postoperative surgical visit. In addition, an appointment had been scheduled at the Center Cardiac Services for pacemaker device check at the clinic on and to come to for her wound check on . DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: Status post coronary artery bypass grafting times four. Atrial fibrillation. History of transient ischemic attack. Hypertension. Hypothyroidism. Status post pacemaker generator change. Status post cholecystectomy. Status post thyroidectomy. DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: . Enteric coated aspirin mg p.o. once daily. . Colace mg p.o. twice daily. .

Approved: TUE : AM Procedure Date: INDICATION: -year-old gentleman with mild mental retardation, recent non-ST elevation MI and refered for evaluation of aspiration. TECHNIQUE: Video oropharyngeal swallow while patient is in upright seated position. FINDINGS: Patient given mutliple consistencies of barium to swallow and evaluated by speech therapy with fluoroscopy. On oral phase, it is noted that patient has oral cavity residue with thin liquids. Patient is also noted to have premature spillover into the pharyngeal cavity with evidence of penetration. Patient has reduced laryngeal elevation and insufficient laryngeal valve closure. Furthermore, patient is noted to have aspiration of penetrated liquid. Video swallow was also done while patient in a chin tuck maneuver, though this was ineffective in preventing penetration with thin liquids. IMPRESSION: . Aspiration of thin liquid. . Chin tuck maneuver not effective with thin liquids. . For more details, please see formal evaluation from speech therapy. THE STUDY AND THE REPORT WERE REVIEWED BY THE STAFF RADIOLOGIST. DR. DR. Approved: : AM Procedure Date: Conclusions PREBYPASS No atrial septal defect is seen by D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is top normal/borderline dilated. There is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed. Resting regional wall motion abnormalities include severe hypokinesis of the apex, mid to distal anterior, inferior, septal walls (lateral wall functions best .LVEF < %. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular systolic function is normal. The aortic valve leaflets ( are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (+ mitral regurgitation is seen. MR increased to moderate (+ with a brief period of ischemia. There is a small pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade. POSTBYPASS The patient is receiving epinephrine at . ucg/kg/min. There is improvement of the anterior and anteroseptal walls in the setting of inotropes. LVEF~-%. RV systolic function remains normal. MR . The remaining study is unchanged from prebypass.

Brief Hospital Course: Briefly, this is a yo male with h/o mild mental retardation, HTN, & DM, who presented to with GI complaints and, during evaluation of a possible GI illness, aspirated on CT contrast material. He subsequently developed respiratory failure and was found to have an inferior MI, for which he was transferred to the CCU. . . CV: Shortly after admission, the pt was found to have an IMI; however, based on the history, ECG & cardiac enzymes the timing of the pt's MI was unclear, possibly having occured >- hours prior. Thus, the patient was not re-vascularized at that time. Medical management for his MI was provided with heparin gtt, aspirin, plavix, and atorvastatin. (Of note, the atorvastatin was later discontinued because of increasingly elevated LFTs while on it. Plans for a diagnostic cardiac catheterization were started. However, because of deterioration in the patient's condition, this procedure was delayed until . The pt underwent a left and right heart catheterization on , which revealed vessel coronary artery disease involving the left anterior descending, left circumflex, and right coronary artery. Because of the patient's condition (he was febrile and volume overloaded, CT surgery felt that the risk of performing CABG at that time was too high. Thus, the pt underwent stenting (with drug eluting stents of the presumed culprit vessel, the left circumflex. Plans for stenting of the LAD or CABG within one week of the cath were made. Results from the right heart catheterization revealed a mixed picture: elements of cardiogenic and septic shock. . The patient showed improvement after PTCI and stenting of the left circumflex: his hemodynamics improved as did his apparent cardiac function. He tolerated aggresive diuresis, and began to show signs of improved respiratory function. He was extubated, and transferred to the floor. On , he underwent CABG. . Respiratory failure: The patient developed hypoxic respiratory failure presumably secondary to aspiration of contrast material. Chest CT revealed moderate bilateral pleural effusions and patchy opacities within the lower lobes and the right upper lobe. He was treated for presumed aspiration pneumonia with vancomycin and Zosyn for days. During this time, he pt failed extubation twice (once was a self-extubation. After stenting of his left circ, he began to show signs of respiratory improvement. With the aid of aggresive diuresis, the patient was able to be slowly weaned off the ventilator. Given his high-risk for re-intubation, steps were made to optimize his condition before extubating. He underwent over hours of minimal support on pressue support ventilation, before successful extubation. . PNA/? sepsis: the patient was treated for presumed aspiration pneumonia initially with Levofloxacin and flagyl. These were discontinued and vancomycin and Zosyn were started. A total of days of Vanco & Zosyn were given. Despite anti-biotic therapy, he continued to spike fevers and have an elevated white count. His hemodynamic measurements also showed evidence of sepsis. was consulted and the patient underwent a thorough work-up for a source of infection. Pan-cultures were negative. Chest CT was suggestive of PNA, for which therapy was continued. The pt's left sided pleural effusion was tapped. The results were negative. Subsequent bronchoscopy was performed and no evidence of pneumonia or other pathologies were found. Abdominal CT failed to reveal any evidence of abscess or infection. Thus, after a near complete course of antibiotic therapy for PNA, antibiotics were discontinued, since no other localizing source could be found. The patient's fever subsequently abated. . Renal Failure: pt had acute renal failure, which was thought to be pre-renal in origin. This resolved as his hemodynamics improved following stenting & diuresis. . Anemia: pt was found to be anemic during his acute illness. His RBC indices were normal. No bleeding source was found. He was did require transfusion. . Diabetes: treated with RISS. . FEN: while intubated tube feeds were given. Following extubation, the pt was noted to be coughing while taking PO food/drink. He underwent a swallowing video study that revealed mild-moderate dysphagia. Speech & swallow recommended resuming tube feeds while pt was recovering and repeat swallowing evaluation upon stabilization. . DM: on sliding scale insulin. Monitor sugars. . Code Status: Full . Social: prior to undergoing CABG, pt made his sister health care proxy. The pt was evaluated by psychiatry prior to CABG to evaluate his ability to consent for surgery. They felt that he understood the risks & benefits adequately & could make the decision himself. Taken to the OR on / for CAG After cabg, he was transferred to CSRU in stable condition on epinephrine, neosynephrine, insulin, milrinone, and propofol drips. Insulin drip off on POD . Epinephrine and propofol weaned off on POD and extubated. Beta blockade started and transfused one unit PRBCs for hct .Milrinine weaned off on POD and chest tubes removed. On POD and gentle diuresis begun, continued on abx for sputum production, and pacing wires removed. Transferred to the floor to begin increasing his activity level.Dobhoff tube placed for feeding. Social worker involved in his discharge planning. Repeat bedside and video swallowing eval done on POD with recommendations to crush all pills and no thin liquids (nectar -thick only. Speech therapy was strongly recommended for his rehab. He had remained hemodynamically stable, and is ready for discharge to rehab to progress with physical therapy, and speech/swallowing therapy.
